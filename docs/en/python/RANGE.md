# Range Constraints and Solving Integer Linear Programming

## Polynomial formulation for range constraints
Let $f$ be a polynomial expression of binary variables.
A range constraint has the form **$l\leq f\leq u$** with $l<u$.
Our goal is to design a polynomial expression that takes the minimum value 0 if and only if the range constraint is satisfied.

The key idea is to introduce an **auxiliary integer variable** $a$ that takes values in the range $[l,u]$.
Consider the following expression:

$$
\begin{aligned}
g &= (f-a)^2
\end{aligned}
$$

This expression $g$ takes the minimum value 0 exactly when $f=a$.
Since $a$ can take any integer value in $[l,u]$, the expression
$g$ achieves 0 if and only if $f$ itself takes an integer value within the same range.

Using this auxiliary-variable technique, PyQBPP implements range constraints via the **`between()`** function.

## Solving Integer Linear Programming
An instance of **integer linear programming** consists of an **objective function** and multiple **linear constraints**.
For example, the following integer linear program has two variables, one objective, and two constraints:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\text{Maximize: } & & & 5x + 4y \\
\text{Subject to: } & && 2x + 3y \le 24 \\
                   & & & 7x + 5y \le 54
\end{aligned}
$$

The optimal solution of this problem is $x=4$, $y=5$, with the objective value $40$.

The following PyQBPP program finds this optimal solution using the Easy Solver:
```python
import pyqbpp as qbpp

x = qbpp.between(qbpp.var_int("x"), 0, 10)
y = qbpp.between(qbpp.var_int("y"), 0, 10)
f = 5 * x + 4 * y
c1 = qbpp.between(2 * x + 3 * y, 0, 24)
c2 = qbpp.between(7 * x + 5 * y, 0, 54)
g = -f + 100 * (c1 + c2)
g.simplify_as_binary()

solver = qbpp.EasySolver(g)
sol = solver.search({"time_limit": 1.0})

print(f"x = {sol(x)}, y = {sol(y)}")
print(f"f = {sol(f)}")
print(f"c1 = {sol(c1)}, c2 = {sol(c2)}")
print(f"2x+3y = {sol(c1.body)}, 7x+5y = {sol(c2.body)}")
```

In this program,
- **`f`** represents the objective function,
- **`c1`** and **`c2`** represent the range constraints created using **`between()`**, and
- **`g`** combines them into a single optimization expression.

Since the goal is maximization, the objective is negated as `-f`.
The constraints `c1` and `c2` are penalized with a weight of 100 to ensure they are satisfied with high priority.

An Easy Solver instance is created for `g`, and a search is performed with a time limit of 1.0 seconds passed as a parameter to `search()`.
After obtaining the optimal solution `sol`, the program prints the values of `x`, `y`, `f`, `c1`, `c2`, and the constraint body expressions.

The program outputs:
```
x = 4, y = 5
f = 40
c1 = 0, c2 = 0
2x+3y = 23, 7x+5y = 53
```
Here,
- **`c1`** is the penalty for the constraint `0 <= 2x + 3y <= 24`, and
- **`c1.body`** represents the linear expression `2x + 3y`.

We can confirm that the solver correctly finds the optimal solution.
