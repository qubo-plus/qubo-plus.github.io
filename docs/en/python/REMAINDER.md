# Remainder Problem
The following problem can be solved using PyQBPP.
Find the minimum non-negative integer $x$ such that

- the remainder when $x$ is divided by 3 is 2,
- the remainder when $x$ is divided by 5 is 3, and
- the remainder when $x$ is divided by 7 is 5.

Since 3, 5, and 7 are pairwise coprime, it is enough to search $x$ within one period:

$$
 0\leq x \leq 3\times 5\times 7 -1
$$

Introduce non-negative integers $d_3$, $d_5$, and $d_7$ (quotients) and rewrite the remainder conditions as linear equalities:

$$
\begin{aligned}
 x - 3d_3 &= 2 \\
 x - 5d_5 &=3 \\
 x - 7d_7 &= 5
\end{aligned}
$$

We want to minimize $x$ subject to these constraints.
From the range $x$ above, we can bound the quotient variables as

$$
\begin{aligned}
 0&\leq d_3 \leq 5\times 7-1 \\
 0&\leq d_5 \leq 3\times 7-1 \\
 0&\leq d_7 \leq 3\times 5-1
\end{aligned}
$$

## PyQBPP program
The following program finds a solution $x$ for this remainder problem:
```python
import pyqbpp as qbpp

x = qbpp.between(qbpp.var_int("x"), 0, 3 * 5 * 7 - 1)
d3 = qbpp.between(qbpp.var_int("d3"), 0, 5 * 7 - 1)
d5 = qbpp.between(qbpp.var_int("d5"), 0, 3 * 7 - 1)
d7 = qbpp.between(qbpp.var_int("d7"), 0, 3 * 5 - 1)
c3 = x - 3 * d3 == 2
c5 = x - 5 * d5 == 3
c7 = x - 7 * d7 == 5
f = x + 1000 * (c3 + c5 + c7)
f.simplify_as_binary()

solver = qbpp.EasySolver(f)
sol = solver.search({"time_limit": 1.0})

print(f"x = {sol(x)}")
print(f"{sol(x)} - 3 * {sol(d3)} = {sol(c3.body)}")
print(f"{sol(x)} - 5 * {sol(d5)} = {sol(c5.body)}")
print(f"{sol(x)} - 7 * {sol(d7)} = {sol(c7.body)}")
```

The three constraints are represented as `c3`, `c5`, and `c7`.
Each of them is converted into a QUBO penalty term that becomes 0 when the corresponding equality holds.

We then minimize `x` with a large penalty weight (1000) so that satisfying the constraints is prioritized over reducing `x`.

Finally, the Easy Solver searches for a low-energy solution of f within the time limit (1.0 second) specified in the parameter dictionary, and the obtained values are printed as follows:
```
x = 68
68 - 3 * 22 = 2
68 - 5 * 13 = 3
68 - 7 * 9 = 5
```
Therefore,

$$
\begin{aligned}
x &\equiv 68 & (\bmod 105)
\end{aligned}
$$

and the minimum solution is $x=68$.
