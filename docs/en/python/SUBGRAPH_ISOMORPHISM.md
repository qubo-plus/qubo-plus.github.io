# Subgraph Isomorphism Problem
Given two undirected graphs $G_H=(V_H,E_H)$ (the host graph) and
$G_G=(V_G,E_G)$ (the guest graph), the **subgraph isomorphism problem** asks whether
$G_H$ contains a subgraph that is isomorphic to $G_G$.

More formally, the goal is to find an **injective mapping** $\sigma:V_G\rightarrow V_H$
such that, for every edge $(u,v)\in E_G$, the pair $(\sigma(u),\sigma(v))$ is also an edge of the host graph, i.e., $(\sigma(u),\sigma(v))\in E_H$.

For example, consider the following host and guest graphs:

## QUBO formulation of the subgraph isomorphism problem
Assume that the **guest graph** $G_G=(V_G,E_G)$ has $m$ nodes labeled $0, 1, \ldots m-1$, and
the **host graph** $G_H=(V_H,E_H)$ has $n$ nodes labeled $0, 1, \ldots n-1$.
We introduce an $m\times n$ **binary matrix** $X=(x_{i,j})$ ($0\leq i\leq m-1, 0\leq j\leq n-1$) with $mn$ binary variables.
This matrix represents an injective mapping $\sigma:V_G\rightarrow V_H$
such that $x_{i,j}=1$ if and only if $\sigma(i)=j$.

Because $X$ represents an injective mapping, it must satisfy the following constraints:
- **Row constraint**: Each guest node is mapped to exactly one host node, i.e., the sum of each row is 1.
- **Column constraint**: Each host node is used by at most one guest node, i.e., the sum of each column is 0 or 1.

Next, we define the objective as the number of guest edges that are mapped to host edges:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\text{objective} &= \sum_{(u_G,v_G)\in E_G}\sum_{(u_H,v_H)\in E_H} (x_{u_G,u_H}x_{v_G,v_H}+x_{u_G,v_H}x_{v_G,u_H})
\end{aligned}
$$

Finally, we combine the objective and the constraint into a single QUBO expression:

$$
\begin{aligned}
f  &= -\text{objective} + mn\times \text{constraint}
\end{aligned}
$$

## PyQBPP program for the subgraph isomorphism problem
```python
import pyqbpp as qbpp

N = 10
host = [
    (0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 6), (2, 5), (3, 7), (4, 6),
    (4, 7), (5, 6), (5, 8), (6, 8), (6, 7), (7, 9), (8, 9)]

M = 6
guest = [
    (0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 3), (2, 5), (3, 4), (4, 5)]

x = qbpp.var("x", M, N)

host_assigned = qbpp.vector_sum(x, 0)

constraint = qbpp.sum(qbpp.constrain(qbpp.vector_sum(x, 1), equal=1)) + qbpp.sum(qbpp.constrain(host_assigned, between=(0, 1)))

objective = 0
for ug, vg in guest:
    for uh, vh in host:
        objective += x[ug][uh] * x[vg][vh] + x[ug][vh] * x[vg][uh]

f = -objective + constraint * (M * N)
f.simplify_as_binary()

solver = qbpp.EasySolver(f)
sol = solver.search(target_energy=-len(guest))

print(f"objective = {sol(objective)}")
print(f"constraint = {sol(constraint)}")

# Extract guest-to-host mapping
print("Guest -> Host mapping:")
for i in range(M):
    for j in range(N):
        if sol(x[i][j]) == 1:
            print(f"  guest {i} -> host {j}")
```
The guest and host graphs are given as edge lists.
We define an $M\times N$ binary matrix `x`, and then construct the expressions `constraint`, `objective`, and `f` according to the formulation above.

An Easy Solver instance is created for `f`, and a search is performed with the target energy $−|E_G|$ (the negative number of guest edges), which is the best possible value of `-objective` when all guest edges are mapped to host edges.

This program produces the following output:
{% raw %}
```
objective = 8
constraint = 0
Guest -> Host mapping:
  guest 0 -> host 1
  guest 1 -> host 4
  guest 2 -> host 6
  guest 3 -> host 7
  guest 4 -> host 9
  guest 5 -> host 8
```
{% endraw %}
The objective value equals the number of guest edges ($|E_G|=8$), and all constraints are satisfied.

## Visualization using matplotlib
The following code visualizes the Subgraph Isomorphism solution on the host graph:
```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import networkx as nx

G_host = nx.Graph()
G_host.add_nodes_from(range(N_host))
G_host.add_edges_from(host_edges)
pos = nx.spring_layout(G_host, seed=42)

# Determine which host nodes are mapped
mapped = [0] * N_host
for i in range(N_guest):
    for j in range(N_host):
        if sol(x[i][j]) == 1:
            mapped[j] = 1
colors = ["#e74c3c" if mapped[j] else "#d5dbdb" for j in range(N_host)]

# Highlight edges corresponding to guest edges
edge_colors = []
edge_widths = []
guest_to_host = {}
for i in range(N_guest):
    for j in range(N_host):
        if sol(x[i][j]) == 1:
            guest_to_host[i] = j
for u, v in host_edges:
    host_to_guest_u = {v2: k for k, v2 in guest_to_host.items()}
    gu = host_to_guest_u.get(u)
    gv = host_to_guest_u.get(v)
    if gu is not None and gv is not None and (gu, gv) in guest_edges or (gv, gu) in guest_edges:
        edge_colors.append("#e74c3c")
        edge_widths.append(2.5)
    else:
        edge_colors.append("#cccccc")
        edge_widths.append(1.0)

nx.draw(G_host, pos, with_labels=True, node_color=colors, node_size=400,
        font_size=9, edge_color=edge_colors, width=edge_widths)
plt.title("Subgraph Isomorphism")
plt.savefig("subgraph_isomorphism.png", dpi=150, bbox_inches="tight")
plt.show()
```

Mapped host nodes are shown in red, and edges corresponding to guest edges are highlighted.
