# Replace Functions

PyQBPP provides the following replace function, which can be used to fix variable values in an expression:
- **`qbpp.replace(f, ml)`**: Returns a new expression in which the variables in `f` are replaced according to the mapping `ml`.
- **`f.replace(ml)`**: Replaces variables in expression `f` in place (mutates `f`).

Here, `ml` is either a Python dict `{var: value, ...}` or a list of `(var, value)` tuples. The values may be integers, `Var`, `Term`, or `Expr`, e.g., `{x: 0, y: ~z}` or `[(x, 0), (y, ~z)]`.

## Using the replace function to fix variable values
We explain the **`qbpp.replace()`** function using the
[PyQBPP program for partitioning problem](PARTITION).
This program finds a partition of the numbers in the following list **`w`** into two subsets $P$ and $Q$ ($=\overline{P}$) such that the difference between their sums is minimized:
```python
w = [64, 27, 47, 74, 12, 83, 63, 40]
```
We modify this partitioning problem so that 64 must belong to $P$ and 27 must belong to $Q$, ensuring that they are placed in distinct subsets.

To enforce this constraint, the values of `x[0]` and `x[1]` are fixed to 1 and 0, respectively, using the `qbpp.replace()` function.

The complete PyQBPP program is shown below:

```python
import pyqbpp as qbpp

w = [64, 27, 47, 74, 12, 83, 63, 40]
x = qbpp.var("x", shape=len(w))
p = qbpp.sum(w * x)
q = qbpp.sum(w * ~x)
f = qbpp.sqr(p - q)
f.simplify_as_binary()

ml = {x[0]: 1, x[1]: 0}
g = qbpp.replace(f, ml)
g.simplify_as_binary()
solver = qbpp.ExhaustiveSolver(g)
sol = solver.search()

full_sol = qbpp.Sol(f).set(sol, ml)

print("sol =", sol)
print("ml =", ml)
print("full_sol =", full_sol)
print("f(full_sol) =", f(full_sol))
print("p(full_sol) =", p(full_sol))
print("q(full_sol) =", q(full_sol))
P = [w[i] for i in range(len(w)) if x[i](full_sol) == 1]
Q = [w[i] for i in range(len(w)) if x[i](full_sol) == 0]
print("P:", P)
print("Q:", Q)
```

First, a dict **`ml`** is defined, which specifies fixed values for the variables `x[0]` and `x[1]`.
Given the original expression `f` for the partitioning problem and the dict `ml`, the **`qbpp.replace()`** function is used to replace `x[0]` and `x[1]` in `f` with the constants 1 and 0, respectively.
The resulting expression is stored in **`g`**.

The Exhaustive Solver is then applied to `g` to find an optimal solution, which is stored in `sol`.
Note that the expression `g` no longer contains the variables `x[0]` and `x[1]`, and consequently, `sol` also does not include assignments for these variables.

To construct a complete solution that includes all variables, we create a zero-initialized solution for `f` via `qbpp.Sol` and then set the binary values using `set(sol, ml)`.

From the output below, we can confirm that 64 is placed in $P$ and 27 is placed in $Q$, as intended:
{% raw %}
```
sol = 4:{{x[2],1},{x[3],0},{x[4],1},{x[5],1},{x[6],0},{x[7],0}}
ml = {x[0]: 1, x[1]: 0}
full_sol = 4:{{x[0],1},{x[1],0},{x[2],1},{x[3],0},{x[4],1},{x[5],1},{x[6],0},{x[7],0}}
f(full_sol) = 4
p(full_sol) = 206
q(full_sol) = 204
P: [64, 47, 12, 83]
Q: [27, 74, 63, 40]
```
{% endraw %}

## Using the replace function to replace variables with expressions
The `replace()` function can also replace a variable with an expression, not only with a constant value.

Here, we present a more sophisticated way to ensure that 64 and 27 are placed in distinct subsets in the partitioning problem introduced above.
The key idea is to replace the variable `x[0]` in the expression `f` with the negated literal `~x[1]`.
This enforces the constraint that `x[0]` and `x[1]` always take opposite values, guaranteeing that the corresponding elements (64 and 27) belong to different subsets.

The following PyQBPP program implements this idea:
```python
ml = {x[0]: ~x[1]}
g = qbpp.replace(f, ml)
g.simplify_as_binary()
solver = qbpp.ExhaustiveSolver(g)
sol = solver.search()

full_sol = qbpp.Sol(f).set(sol, ml)
```
In this program, a dict `ml` is defined so that the variable `x[0]` is replaced by the negated literal `~x[1]`.

The `qbpp.replace()` function applies this substitution to the original expression `f`, and the resulting expression is stored in `g`.
As a result, `g` no longer contains the variable `x[0]`; instead, all occurrences of `x[0]` are replaced by `~x[1]`.

The Exhaustive Solver is then used to find an optimal solution for `g`, which is stored in `sol`.
Since `x[0]` does not appear in `g`, the solution `sol` also does not include an assignment for `x[0]`.

To construct a complete solution over the original variables in `f`, we start with a zero-initialized solution via `qbpp.Sol(f)` and then populate it by calling `set(sol, ml)`.
Note that `sol` and `ml` must be passed to `set()` together (as a list), because the mapping in `ml` (e.g., `x[0] = ~x[1]`) may depend on variable values contained in `sol`.

This program produces the following output:
{% raw %}
```
sol = 4:{{x[1],0},{x[2],1},{x[3],0},{x[4],1},{x[5],1},{x[6],0},{x[7],0}}
ml = {x[0]: ~x[1]}
full_sol = 4:{{x[0],1},{x[1],0},{x[2],1},{x[3],0},{x[4],1},{x[5],1},{x[6],0},{x[7],0}}
f(full_sol) = 4
p(full_sol) = 206
q(full_sol) = 204
P: [64, 47, 12, 83]
Q: [27, 74, 63, 40]
```
{% endraw %}
We can confirm that:
- the solution `sol` does not include `x[0]`,
- `x[0]` and `x[1]` take opposite values, and
- 64 and 27 are placed in distinct subsets, as intended.

## Replace Functions for Integer Variables
Integer variables can be replaced with fixed integer values using the `replace()` function.
When an integer variable is used as a key in the mapping, PyQBPP automatically expands it into its internal binary variables.

Here, we demonstrate this feature using a simple **multiplication expression**.
Let $p$, $q$, and $r$ be integer variables, and consider the following constraint:

$$
\begin{aligned}
p\times q - r &=0
\end{aligned}
$$

This expression can be interpreted in several ways, leading to different types of problems:
- **Multiplication**: For fixed values of $p$ and $q$, find $r$ that satisfies the expression.
- **Factorization**: For a fixed value of $r$, find $p$ and $q$ that satisfy the expression.
- **Division**: For fixed values of $p$ and $r$, find $q$ that satisfies the expression.

Using the **`qbpp.replace()`** function, integer variables can be fixed to constant values.
We demonstrate PyQBPP programs that solve these problems using `qbpp.replace()`.

### Multiplication
The following program fixes $p=5$ and $q=7$ and finds the product $r=35$:
```python
import pyqbpp as qbpp

p = qbpp.var("p", between=(2, 8))
q = qbpp.var("q", between=(2, 8))
r = qbpp.var("r", between=(2, 40))
f = qbpp.constrain(p * q - r, equal=0)
f.simplify_as_binary()

ml = {p: 5, q: 7}
g = qbpp.replace(f, ml)
g.simplify_as_binary()
print("g =", g)

solver = qbpp.EasySolver(g)
sol = solver.search(target_energy=0)

full_sol = qbpp.Sol(f).set(sol, ml)
print(f"p={full_sol(p)}, q={full_sol(q)}, r={full_sol(r)}")
```
In this program, a dict `ml` is used to fix the values of the integer variables
`p` and `q` in the original expression `f`.
By applying `qbpp.replace(f, ml)`, the variables `p` and `q` in `f` are replaced with the constants 5 and 7, respectively.
The resulting expression is stored in `g`, which now contains only the variable `r`.
The Easy Solver is then applied to `g`, and the resulting solution is stored in `sol`.
To construct a complete solution that includes all variables, we create a zero-initialized solution for `f` via `qbpp.Sol` and then set the binary values using `set(sol, ml)`.
Finally, the values of `p`, `q`, and `r` are printed.

This program produces the following output, confirming that the multiplication result is obtained correctly:
```
g = 1089 -65*r[0] -128*r[1] -248*r[2] -464*r[3] -800*r[4] -413*r[5] +4*r[0]*r[1] +8*r[0]*r[2] +16*r[0]*r[3] +32*r[0]*r[4] +14*r[0]*r[5] +16*r[1]*r[2] +32*r[1]*r[3] +64*r[1]*r[4] +28*r[1]*r[5] +64*r[2]*r[3] +128*r[2]*r[4] +56*r[2]*r[5] +256*r[3]*r[4] +112*r[3]*r[5] +224*r[4]*r[5]
p=5, q=7, r=35
```

### Factorization
For the factorization of $r=35$, the dict `ml` in the PyQBPP program is modified as follows:
```python
ml = {r: 35}
```
By fixing the value of $r$, the solver searches for integer values of $p$ and $q$ that satisfy the constraint

$$
\begin{aligned}
p\times q&=35
\end{aligned}
$$

This program produces the following output:
```
g = 961 -120*p[0] -232*p[1] -336*p[2] -120*q[0] -232*q[1] -336*q[2] +16*p[0]*p[1] +24*p[0]*p[2] -45*p[0]*q[0] -80*p[0]*q[1] -105*p[0]*q[2] +48*p[1]*p[2] -80*p[1]*q[0] -136*p[1]*q[1] -168*p[1]*q[2] -105*p[2]*q[0] -168*p[2]*q[1] -189*p[2]*q[2] +16*q[0]*q[1] +24*q[0]*q[2] +48*q[1]*q[2] +20*p[0]*p[1]*q[0] +48*p[0]*p[1]*q[1] +84*p[0]*p[1]*q[2] +30*p[0]*p[2]*q[0] +72*p[0]*p[2]*q[1] +126*p[0]*p[2]*q[2] +20*p[0]*q[0]*q[1] +30*p[0]*q[0]*q[2] +60*p[0]*q[1]*q[2] +60*p[1]*p[2]*q[0] +144*p[1]*p[2]*q[1] +252*p[1]*p[2]*q[2] +48*p[1]*q[0]*q[1] +72*p[1]*q[0]*q[2] +144*p[1]*q[1]*q[2] +84*p[2]*q[0]*q[1] +126*p[2]*q[0]*q[2] +252*p[2]*q[1]*q[2] +16*p[0]*p[1]*q[0]*q[1] +24*p[0]*p[1]*q[0]*q[2] +48*p[0]*p[1]*q[1]*q[2] +24*p[0]*p[2]*q[0]*q[1] +36*p[0]*p[2]*q[0]*q[2] +72*p[0]*p[2]*q[1]*q[2] +48*p[1]*p[2]*q[0]*q[1] +72*p[1]*p[2]*q[0]*q[2] +144*p[1]*p[2]*q[1]*q[2]
p=5, q=7, r=35
```

### Division
To compute the division $r/p$ with $r=35$ and $p=5$, the dict `ml` in the PyQBPP program is modified as follows:
```python
ml = {p: 5, r: 35}
```
This program produces the following output:
```
g = 625 -225*q[0] -400*q[1] -525*q[2] +100*q[0]*q[1] +150*q[0]*q[2] +300*q[1]*q[2]
p=5, q=7, r=35
```
This confirms that the division result $q=r/p=7$ is correctly obtained.

> **NOTE**
> PyQBPP also provides a member function version of `replace()` for expressions.
> In other words:
> - **`f.replace(ml)`** updates the expression `f` in place by applying the replacements specified in `ml`.
> - **`qbpp.replace(f, ml)`** returns a new expression in which the replacements have been applied, without modifying the original expression `f`.
> Use `f.replace(ml)` when you want to permanently modify an existing expression, and use `qbpp.replace(f, ml)` when you want to keep the original expression unchanged.

> **NOTE: Using `replace()` with Terms**
> Both `qbpp.replace(t, ml)` and `t.replace(ml)` work with terms.
> The term is promoted to an expression, and a new expression is returned:
> ```python
> t = ~a * b * ~c * ~d  # Term
> e = t.replace({~a: 1 - a, ~c: 1 - c, d: 1 - d})  # returns Expr
> ```

> **NOTE: `replace()` on constraint expressions**
> The member function `replace()` is **not** available on constraint expressions.
> Use the free function form instead:
> ```python
> ee2 = qbpp.replace(ee, {x: 0, y: 1})  # works with a constraint expression
> ```

> **NOTE: Mapping as a list of tuples**
> The mapping `ml` can also be supplied as a list of `(var, value)` tuples
> instead of a dict:
> ```python
> ml = [(x[0], 1), (x[1], 0)]
> g = qbpp.replace(f, ml)
> ```

> **NOTE: Negated literals and `replace()`**
> The `replace()` function treats `x` and `~x` as independent keys.
> Specifying `{x: 0}` in the dict does **not** automatically replace `~x` with `1`.
> If the expression contains negated literals such as `~x`, you should explicitly include both mappings:
> ```python
> ml = {x: 0, ~x: 1}
> ```
