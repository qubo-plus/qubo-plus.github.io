# Shift Scheduling Problem
Consider the following **shift scheduling problem**, which aims to find a schedule that minimizes the total worker cost.

- There are 6 workers and a planning horizon of 31 days, from day 1 to day 31.
For simplicity, we assume that all workers are off on day 0 and day 32.
- Exactly 4 workers must be scheduled on each day from day 1 to day 31.
- The following constraints must be satisfied for each worker:
  - works for either 20 or 21 days,
  - works no more than 6 consecutive days,
  - works no fewer than 3 consecutive days,
  - has no isolated day off; days off must be consecutive.

## PyQBPP program for the shift scheduling
```python
import pyqbpp as qbpp

days = 31
worker_cost = [13, 13, 12, 12, 11, 10]
workers = len(worker_cost)

x = qbpp.var("x", workers, days + 2)

workers_each_day = qbpp.vector_sum(x, 0)
each_day_4_workers = 0
for j in range(1, days + 1):
    each_day_4_workers += qbpp.constrain(workers_each_day[j], equal=4)

workers_working_days = qbpp.vector_sum(x)
work_20_21_days = 0
for i in range(workers):
    work_20_21_days += qbpp.constrain(workers_working_days[i], between=(20, 21))

no_more_than_6 = 0
for w in range(workers):
    for j in range(days - 5):
        no_more_than_6 += (x[w][j] * x[w][j+1] * x[w][j+2] *
                           x[w][j+3] * x[w][j+4] * x[w][j+5] * x[w][j+6])

no_less_than_3 = 0
for w in range(workers):
    for j in range(days - 1):
        no_less_than_3 += ~x[w][j] * x[w][j+1] * x[w][j+2] * ~x[w][j+3]
    for j in range(days):
        no_less_than_3 += ~x[w][j] * x[w][j+1] * ~x[w][j+2]

no_single_day_off = 0
for w in range(workers):
    for j in range(days):
        no_single_day_off += x[w][j] * ~x[w][j+1] * x[w][j+2]

total_worker_cost = 0
for i in range(workers):
    total_worker_cost += worker_cost[i] * workers_working_days[i]

constraints = (work_20_21_days + no_less_than_3 + no_more_than_6 +
               no_single_day_off + each_day_4_workers)
f = total_worker_cost + 10000 * constraints

ml = {x[i][0]: 0 for i in range(workers)}
ml.update({x[i][days + 1]: 0 for i in range(workers)})
f.simplify_as_binary()

g = qbpp.replace(f, ml)
g.simplify_as_binary()

solver = qbpp.EasySolver(g)
sol = solver.search(time_limit=5.0, target_energy=0)

full_sol = qbpp.Sol(f).set([ml, sol])

for i in range(workers):
    wd = full_sol(workers_working_days[i])
    bits = "".join(str(full_sol(x[i][j])) for j in range(1, days + 1))
    print(f"Worker {i}: {wd} days worked: {bits}")

day_counts = "".join(str(full_sol(workers_each_day[d])) for d in range(1, days + 1))
print(f"Workers each day        : {day_counts}")
print(f"Total worker cost: {full_sol(total_worker_cost)}")
print(f"Constraints violations: {full_sol(constraints)}")
```
The obtained solution is as follows:
```
Worker 0: 20 days worked: 0001111001110011111001111001111
Worker 1: 20 days worked: 1111001111110001111110011110000
Worker 2: 21 days worked: 0000111100111110011111100111111
Worker 3: 21 days worked: 1111110011111100111000111111000
Worker 4: 21 days worked: 1111100111001111000111000111111
Worker 5: 21 days worked: 1110011110001111100111111000111
Workers each day        : 4444444444444444444444444444444
Total worker cost: 1465
Constraints violations: 0
```
