# Minimum Set Cover Problem
Let $U$ be a universe set, and let ${\cal 𝐹}=\lbrace S_0, S_1, \ldots S_{m-1}\rbrace$ be a family of subsets of $U$.
A subfamily $\cal S\subseteq \cal F$ is called a **set cover** if it covers all elements of $U$, i.e.,

$$
\begin{aligned}
\bigcup_{S_j\subseteq \cal S}S_j &= U.
\end{aligned}
$$

The **minimum set cover problem** is to find a set cover
$\cal S$ with the minimum cardinality.
Here, we consider the weighted version, where each subset
$S_j$ has a weight $w_j$, and the goal is to find a **set cover with the minimum total weight**.

## HUBO formulation of the minimum set cover problem
We formulate this problem as a HUBO problem.
Assume that $U=\lbrace 0,1,\ldots, n-1\rbrace$, and $m$ subsets $S_0, S_1, \ldots, S_{m-1}$ are given.
We introduce $m$ binary variables $x_0, x_1, \ldots, x_{m-1}$,
where $x_j=1$ if and only if $S_j\in\cal S$.

For each element $i\in U$, define the following expression:

$$
\begin{aligned}
c_i &=\prod_{j: i\in S_j}\bar{x}_j && (0\leq i\leq n-1)
\end{aligned}
$$

If none of the selected subsets contains $i$, then $i$ is not covered.
In that case, $x_j=0$ holds for all $j$ such that $i\in S_j$
and hence $c_i=1$.
On the other hand, if at least one selected subset contains $i$, then $x_j$=1 for some $j$ with $i\in S$, and the factor $\bar{x}_j$ becomes 0, so $c_i=0$.
Therefore, the following **constraint** becomes 0 if and only if all elements are covered:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\text{constraint} &=\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}c_i
\end{aligned}
$$

The **objective** is to minimize the total weight of the selected subsets:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\text{objective} &=\sum_{j=0}^{m-1}w_jx_j
\end{aligned}
$$

We can now construct a HUBO objective function for the weighted minimum set cover problem as:

$$
\begin{aligned}
f &= \text{objective}+P\times\text{constraint},
\end{aligned}
$$

where $P$ is a sufficiently large positive constant to prioritize feasibility over the objective.

## PyQBPP program for the minimum set cover problem
The following PyQBPP program constructs a HUBO expression for a weighted minimum set cover instance with $n=10$ elements and $m=8$ subsets:
{% raw %}
```python
import pyqbpp as qbpp

n = 10
cover = [
    [0, 1, 2], [2, 3, 4],       [4, 5, 6],    [6, 7, 8],
    [9, 0, 1], [1, 3, 5, 7, 9], [0, 3, 6, 9], [1, 4, 7, 8]]
cost = [3, 4, 3, 2, 3, 4, 3, 3]
m = len(cover)

x = qbpp.var("x", shape=m)

c = [1 for _ in range(n)]  # initialize all elements to 1
for i in range(m):
    for j in cover[i]:
        c[j] *= ~x[i]

objective = qbpp.sum(cost * x)

constraint = qbpp.sum(c)

f = objective + 1000 * constraint

f.simplify_as_binary()
solver = qbpp.ExhaustiveSolver(f)

sol = solver.search()

print(f"objective = {sol(objective)}")
print(f"constraint = {sol(constraint)}")

for i in range(m):
    if sol(x[i]) == 1:
        sep = ",".join(str(k) for k in cover[i])
        print(f"Set {i}: {{{sep}}} cost = {cost[i]}")
```
{% endraw %}
This program defines an array **`x`** of $m=8$ **binary variables** and constructs a list **`c`** of $n=10$ **expressions**.
Each expression `c[j]` corresponds to an element $j\in U$ and is initialized to 1.
For every subset $S_i$, and for every element $j\in S_i$, we multiply `c[j]` by
`~x[i]`.
As a result, `c[j]` becomes 0 if at least one selected subset covers element `j`, and remains 1 otherwise.

The **`constraint`** is defined as the sum of all entries in `c`, and it becomes 0 if and only if all elements are covered.
The weighted **`objective`** is defined as the sum of `cost[i] * x[i]`.
They are combined into the HUBO expression:

$$
\begin{aligned}
f &= \text{objective} + 1000\times\text{constraint},
\end{aligned}
$$

where the penalty constant 1000 is chosen sufficiently large to prioritize feasibility.

The Exhaustive Solver is then used to find an optimal solution `sol`.
The program prints the values of `objective` and `constraint`, and finally lists all selected subsets. For example, the output is:
```
objective = 11
constraint = 0
Set 0: {0,1,2} cost = 3
Set 2: {4,5,6} cost = 3
Set 3: {6,7,8} cost = 2
Set 6: {0,3,6,9} cost = 3
```
This output indicates that a feasible set cover with total cost 11 is obtained.

## QUBO formulation for the minimum set cover problem
The HUBO formulation above may contain terms of degree three or higher, and therefore it is not necessarily a QUBO expression.
To obtain a QUBO formulation, we rewrite the covering constraint.

For each element $i\in U$, define

$$
\begin{aligned}
c_i &=\sum_{j: i\in S_j} x_j && (0\leq i\leq n-1)
\end{aligned}
$$

If $c_i\geq 1$, then at least one selected subset $S_j$ covers $i$.
If $c_i=0$, then no selected subset covers $i$.
Thus, we can express the covering constraint in the PyQBPP style as:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\text{constraint} &= \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} (c_i\geq 1)
\end{aligned}
$$

This constraint takes the minimum value 0 if and only if all elements are covered.
Based on this formulation, the PyQBPP program can be modified as follows:
```python
c = [0 for _ in range(n)]
for i in range(m):
    for j in cover[i]:
        c[j] += x[i]

constraint = qbpp.sum(qbpp.constrain(c[j], between=(1, m)) for j in range(n))
```
In this program, the constraint expressions `qbpp.constrain(c[j], between=(1, m))` are created for all
`j`, and their sum is stored in `constraint`.

> **Remark**.
> The expression `qbpp.constrain(c[j], between=(1, m))` may introduce auxiliary binary variables
> internally. As a result, the final expression can be handled by a QUBO solver,
> while preserving the intended meaning of the coverage constraint.

With this modification, the program produces the same optimal solution as the HUBO version.
