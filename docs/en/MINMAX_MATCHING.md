# Minimum Maximal Matching Problem

A **matching** in an undirected graph is a set of edges such that no two edges share a common endpoint.
A **maximal matching** is a matching to which no additional edge can be added without violating the matching condition.
Given an undirected graph $G=(V,E)$, the minimum maximal matching problem asks for a maximal matching $S \subseteq E$ with the minimum number of edges.

The maximality condition of a matching can be described in a compact way.
For a node $u\in V$, let $N(u)$ denote the set of edges in $S$ incident to $u$.
Then $S$ is a maximal matching if and only if, for every edge $(u,v)\in E$, the following condition holds:

$$
 1 \leq |N(u)|+|N(v)| \leq 2
$$

This condition is satisfied if and only if $S$ constitute a maximal matching. To ensure that $S$ is a maximal matching, the following cases cover all possibilities:

We can formulate the minimum maximal matching problem as finding a subset $S$ that satisfies the above condition and has minimum cardinality.

For a formal proof, see the following paper:

# QUBO formuation for the minimum maximal matching
Assume that the graph has $n$ vertices and $m$ edges, and that the edges are labeled $0,1,\ldots,m-1$.
We introduce $m$ binary variables $x_0, x_1, \ldots, x_{m-1}$, where $x_i=1$ if and only if edge $i$ is selected (i.e., belongs to $S$).
The objective is to minimize the number of selected edges:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\text{objective} &= \sum_{i=0}^{m-1} x_i .
\end{aligned}
$$

To enforce the maximality condition, we use the following constraint:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\text{constraint} &= \sum_{(u,v)\in E} (1 \leq |N(u)|+|N(v)| \leq 2)
\end{aligned}
$$

We construct a QUBO expression $f$ by combining the objective and the constraint as follows:

$$
\begin{aligned}
f &= \text{objective} + \text{constraint}.
\end{aligned}
$$

## QUBO++ program
The following QUBO++ program finds a minimum maximal matching of a fixed undirected graph with $N=16$ nodes and $M=27$ edges:
```cpp
#include <qbpp/qbpp.hpp>
#include <qbpp/exhaustive_solver.hpp>
#include <qbpp/graph.hpp>

int main() {
  const size_t N = 16;
  std::vector<std::pair<size_t, size_t>> edges = {
      {0, 1},   {0, 2},   {1, 3},   {1, 4},   {2, 5},   {2, 6},   {3, 7},
      {3, 13},  {4, 6},   {4, 7},   {4, 14},  {5, 8},   {6, 8},   {6, 12},
      {6, 14},  {7, 14},  {8, 9},   {9, 10},  {9, 12},  {10, 11}, {10, 12},
      {11, 13}, {11, 15}, {12, 14}, {12, 15}, {13, 15}, {14, 15}};
  const size_t M = edges.size();

  std::vector<std::vector<size_t>> adj(N);
  for (size_t i = 0; i < M; ++i) {
    const auto& edge = edges[i];
    adj[edge.first].push_back(i);
    adj[edge.second].push_back(i);
  }

  auto x = qbpp::var("x", M);

  auto objective = qbpp::sum(x);

  auto constraint = qbpp::toExpr(0);
  for (const auto& e : edges) {
    auto u = e.first;
    auto v = e.second;
    auto t = qbpp::toExpr(0);
    for (const auto idx : adj[u]) {
      t += x[idx];
    }
    for (const auto idx : adj[v]) {
      t += x[idx];
    }
    constraint += 1 <= t <= 2;
  }

  auto f = objective + constraint;

  f.simplify_as_binary();
  auto solver = qbpp::ExhaustiveSolver(f);
  auto sol = solver.search();

  std::cout << "objective = " << objective(sol) << std::endl;
  std::cout << "constraint = " << constraint(sol) << std::endl;

  qbpp::graph::GraphDrawer graph;
  std::vector<int> selected_nodes(N);
  for (size_t i = 0; i < M; ++i) {
    if (sol(x[i])) {
      selected_nodes[edges[i].first] = 1;
      selected_nodes[edges[i].second] = 1;
    }
  }
  for (size_t i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
    graph.add_node(qbpp::graph::Node(i).color(selected_nodes[i]));
  }
  for (size_t i = 0; i < M; ++i) {
    auto edge = qbpp::graph::Edge(edges[i].first, edges[i].second);
    if (sol(x[i])) {
      edge.color(1).penwidth(2.0);
    }
    graph.add_edge(edge);
  }
  graph.write("minmaxmatching.svg");
}
```
We first define a vector `x` of `M` binary variables, and then define `objective`, `constraint`, and `f` based on the formulation above.
The Exhaustive Solver is used to find an optimal solution of `f`.
The values of objective and constraint are printed, and the resulting graph is saved to `minmaxmatching.svg`.

This program produces the following output:
```
objective = 6
constraint = 0
```
Thus, $S$ contains 6 edges.
The resulting graph stored in `minmaxmatching.svg` is shown below:
<p align="center">
  <img src="../images/minmaxmatching.svg" alt="The solution of the minimum maximum matching problem." width="80%">
</p>
In this graph, the selected edges in $S$ and all nodes incident to these edges are highlighted.
We can see that no more edge can be added, and the maximality condition is satisfied.
