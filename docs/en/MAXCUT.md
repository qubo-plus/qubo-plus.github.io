# Max-Cut Problem

Given an undirected graph $G=(V,E)$, the **Max-Cut** problem aims to partition the node set $V$ into two disjoint subsets $S$ and $\overline{S}$ so that the number of edges in $E$ that have one endpoint in $S$ and the other in $\overline{S}$ is **maximized**.

Assume that the nodes are labeled $0,1,\ldots,n-1$.
We introduce $n$ binary variables $x_0, x_1, \ldots, x_{n-1}$, where
$x_i=1$ if and only if node $i$ belongs to $S$ ($0\le i\le n-1$).
Then, the number of edges crossing the cut $(S,\overline{S})$ is given by

$$
\begin{aligned}
\text{objective} &= \sum_{(i,j)\in E}\Bigl(x_i\bar{x}_j + \bar{x}_ix_j\Bigr).
\end{aligned}
$$

Since the QUBO problems aims to **minimize** an objective function, we obtain a QUBO expression $f$ by **negating** the objective:

$$
\begin{aligned}
f &= -\,\text{objective}.
\end{aligned}
$$

An optimal assignment minimizing $f$ corresponds to a maximum cut of $G$.
Moreover, the value of $\text{objective}$ equals the number of edges crossing between $S$ and $\overline{S}$.

## QUBO++ program for the MAX-CUT problem
Based on the formulation above, the following QUBO++ program constructs the QUBO expression $f$ for a 16-node graph and solves it using the Exhaustive Solver:

```cpp
#include <qbpp/qbpp.hpp>
#include <qbpp/exhaustive_solver.hpp>
#include <qbpp/graph.hpp>

int main() {
  const size_t N = 16;
  std::vector<std::pair<size_t, size_t>> edges = {
      {0, 1},   {0, 2},   {1, 3},   {1, 4},   {2, 5},   {2, 6},   {3, 7},
      {3, 13},  {4, 6},   {4, 7},   {4, 14},  {5, 8},   {6, 8},   {6, 12},
      {6, 14},  {7, 14},  {8, 9},   {9, 10},  {9, 12},  {10, 11}, {10, 12},
      {11, 13}, {11, 15}, {12, 14}, {12, 15}, {13, 15}, {14, 15}};

  auto x = qbpp::var("x", N);

  auto objective = qbpp::toExpr(0);
  for (const auto& edge : edges) {
    objective += x[edge.first] * ~x[edge.second] +
                 ~x[edge.first] * x[edge.second];
  }

  auto f = -objective;
  f.simplify_as_binary();

  auto solver = qbpp::ExhaustiveSolver(f);
  auto sol = solver.search();

  std::cout << "objective = " << objective(sol) << std::endl;
  qbpp::graph::GraphDrawer graph;
  for (size_t i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
    graph.add_node(qbpp::graph::Node(i).color(sol(x[i])));
  }
  for (const auto& e : edges) {
    auto edge = qbpp::graph::Edge(e.first, e.second);
    if (sol(x[e.first]) != sol(x[e.second])) {
      edge.color(1).penwidth(2.0);
    }
    graph.add_edge(edge);
  }
  graph.write("maxcut.svg");
}
```
This program creates the expressions `objective` and `f`, where `f` is the negation of `objective`.
The Exhaustive Solver minimizes `f`, and an optimal assignment is stored in `sol`.

To visualize the solution, a `GraphDrawer` object `graph` is created and populated with nodes and edges.
In this visualization, nodes $i$ in S (i.e., those with $x_i=1$) are colored, and edges crossing the cut are highlighted.

This program prints the following output:
```
objective = 22
```
The resulting graph is rendered and stored in the file `maxcut.svg`:
