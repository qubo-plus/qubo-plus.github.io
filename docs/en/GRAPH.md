# QUBO++ Simple Graph Drawing Library and Solving the Maximum Independent Set (MIS) Problem

## QUBO++ Simple Graph Drawing Library
QUBO++ bundles a simple graph drawing library to visualize results obtained from graph-theoretic problems.
It is a wrapper around Graphviz, which you can install on Ubuntu as follows:

```bash
sudo apt install graphviz
```

To use this library, include `qbpp/graph.hpp`:
```cpp
#include <qbpp/graph.hpp>
```

The library generates DOT input and invokes `neato` to render graphs.

> **WARNING**: This header-only library is intended for visualizing results produced by QUBO++ sample programs.
> Its API and behavior may change without notice, and it should not be used in mission-critical applications.

## Maximum Independent Set (MIS) Problem

An independent set of an undirected graph $G=(V,E)$ is a subset of vertices $S\subseteq V$ such that no two vertices in $S$ are connected by an edge in $E$.
The Maximum Independent Set (MIS) problem asks for an independent set with maximum cardinality.

The MIS problem can be formulated as a QUBO as follows.
Assume that $G$ has $n$ vertices indexed from $0$ to $n-1$.
We introduce $n$ binary variables $x_i$ $(0\le i\le n-1)$, where $x_i=1$ if and only if vertex $i$ is included in $S$.
Since we want to maximize $|S|=\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}x_i$, we minimize the following objective:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\text{objective} = -\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} x_i .
\end{aligned}
$$

To enforce independence, for every edge $(i,j)\in E$ we must not select both endpoints simultaneously.
This can be penalized by

$$
\begin{aligned}
\text{constraint} = \sum_{(i,j)\in E} x_i x_j .
\end{aligned}
$$

Combining the objective and the penalty yields the QUBO function

$$
\begin{aligned}
f = \text{objective} + 2\times\text{constraint}.
\end{aligned}
$$

The penalty coefficient $2$ is sufficient to prioritize feasibility over increasing the set size.

## QUBO++ Program for the MIS Problem
Based on the QUBO formulation of the MIS problem described above, the following QUBO++ program solves an instance with 16 nodes. The edges are stored in `edges`, and the obtained solution is visualized using the QUBO++ graph drawing library:
```cpp
#include <qbpp/qbpp.hpp>
#include <qbpp/exhaustive_solver.hpp>
#include <qbpp/graph.hpp>

int main() {
  const size_t N = 16;
  std::vector<std::pair<size_t, size_t>> edges = {
      {0, 1},   {0, 2},   {1, 3},   {1, 4},   {2, 5},  {2, 6},
      {3, 7},   {3, 13},  {4, 6},   {4, 7},   {5, 8},  {6, 8},
      {6, 14},  {7, 14},  {8, 9},   {9, 10},  {9, 12}, {10, 11},
      {10, 12}, {11, 13}, {12, 14}, {13, 15}, {14, 15}};

  auto x = qbpp::var("x", N);

  auto objective = -qbpp::sum(x);
  auto constraint = qbpp::toExpr(0);
  for (const auto& e : edges) {
    constraint += x[e.first] * x[e.second];
  }
  auto f = objective + constraint * 2;
  f.simplify_as_binary();

  auto solver = qbpp::ExhaustiveSolver(f);
  auto sol = solver.search();

  std::cout << "objective = " << objective(sol) << std::endl;
  std::cout << "constraint = " << constraint(sol) << std::endl;

  qbpp::graph::GraphDrawer graph;
  for (size_t i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
    graph.add_node(qbpp::graph::Node(i).color(sol(x[i])));
  }
  for (const auto& e : edges) {
    graph.add_edge(qbpp::graph::Edge(e.first, e.second));
  }
  graph.write("mis.svg");
}
```
For a vector `x` of `N = 16` binary variables, the expressions `objective`, `constraint`, and `f` are constructed according to the above QUBO formulation.
The Exhaustive Solver is then used to find an optimal solution for `f`, which is stored in `sol`. The values of `objective` and `constraint` evaluated at `sol` are printed.

A `qbpp::graph::GraphDrawer` object, `graph`, is created next. In the loop over `i`, a `qbpp::graph::Node` object is created with label `i`, and its color is set to 0 or 1 depending on the value of `x[i]` in `sol` via the `color()` member function. Each node is added to graph using `add_node()`.

Similarly, in the loop over edges, an `qbpp::graph::Edge(e.first, e.second)` object is created for each edge and added to graph using `add_edge()`. Finally, `graph.write("mis.svg")` renders the graph and writes the resulting image to `mis.svg`.

This program produces the following output:
```
objective = -7
constraint = 0
```
This implies that the obtained solution selects 7 nodes and satisfies all constraints. The rendered image is saved as `mis.svg`:

## API of the QUBO++ Simple Graph Drawing Library
The QUBO++ Simple Graph Drawing Library provides the following classes:
- **`qbpp::graph::Node`**:
Stores node information such as the label, color, pen width, and position.
- **`qbpp::graph::Edge`**:
Stores edge information such as the two endpoint nodes, whether the edge is directed or undirected, its color, and pen width.
- **`qbpp::graph::GraphDrawing`**:
Stores vectors of `qbpp::graph::Node` and `qbpp::graph::Edge` that together constitute a graph.

### `qbpp::graph::Node`
- **`Node(std::string s)`**:
Constructs a node whose label is s.
- **`Node(size_t i)`**
Constructs a node whose label is `std::to_string(i)`.
- **`color(std::string s)`**
Sets the node color to s, which must be in the form `#RRGGBB`.
- **`color(int i)`**:
Sets the node color to the `i`-th entry in the color palette. The default color 0 is white.
- **`penwidth(float f)`**:
Sets the pen width to `f` for drawing the node outline.
- **`position(float x, float y)`**:
Sets the node position to `(x, y)`.

### `qbpp::graph::Edge`
The following constructors and member functions are supported:
- **`Edge(std::string from, std::string to)`**:
Constructs an edge connecting the nodes labeled from and to.
- **`Edge(size_t from, size_t to)`**;
Constructs an edge connecting the node labeled `std::to_string(from)` to the node labeled `std::to_string(to)`.
- **`directed()`**:
Configures the edge as directed.
- **`color(std::string s)`**:
Sets the edge color to `s`, which must be in the form `#RRGGBB`.
- **`color(int i)`**:

- **`penwidth(float f)`**:

### `qbpp::graph::GraphDrawing`
The following member functions are supported:
- **`add_node(const Node& node)`**:

Appends edge to the graph.
- **`write(std::string file_name)`**:
Renders the graph and writes it to `file_name`.
Supported formats include `svg`, `png`, `jpg`, and `pdf` (via Graphviz).
The output format is determined by the file extension.
