# Permutation matrix generation

Many combinatorial optimization problems are permutation-based in the sense that the objective is to find an optimal permutation.
As a fundamental technique for formulating such optimization problems, a matrix of binary variables is used in their QUBO formulation.

## Permutation matrix
Let $X=(x_{i,j})$ ($0\leq i,j\leq n-1$) is a matrix of $n\times n$ binary values.
The matrix $X$ is called a **permutation matrix** if and only if every row and every column has exactly one entry equal to 1, as shown below.

<p align="center">

</p>

A **permutation matrix** represents a permutation of $n$ numbers $(0,1,\ldots,n-1)$, where $x_{i,j} = 1$ if and only if the $i$-th element is $j$.
For example, the above permutation matrix represents the permutation $(1,3,0,2)$.

## QUBO formulation for permutation matrices
A binary variable matrix $X=(x_{i,j})$ ($0\leq i,j\leq n-1$)
stores a permutation matrix if and only if the sum of each row and each column is 1.
Thus, the following QUBO function takes the minimum value 0 if and only if $X$ stores a permutation matrix:

$$
\begin{aligned}
f(X) &= \sum_{i=0}^{n-1}\left(1-\sum_{j=0}^{n-1}x_{i,j}\right)^2+\sum_{j=0}^{n-1}\left(1-\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}x_{i,j}\right)^2
\end{aligned}
$$

## QUBO++ program for generating permutation matrices
We can design a QUBO++ program based on the formula $f(X)$ above as follows:
{% raw %}
```cpp
#include <qbpp/qbpp.hpp>
#include <qbpp/exhaustive_solver.hpp>

int main() {
  auto x = qbpp::var("x", 4, 4);
  auto f = qbpp::expr();

  for (size_t i = 0; i < 4; i++) {
    auto s = qbpp::expr();
    for (size_t j = 0; j < 4; j++) {
      s += x[i][j];
    }
    f += qbpp::sqr(1 - s);
  }

  for (size_t j = 0; j < 4; j++) {
    auto s = qbpp::expr();
    for (size_t i = 0; i < 4; i++) {
      s += x[i][j];
    }
    f += qbpp::sqr(1 - s);
  }

  f.simplify_as_binary();
  auto solver = qbpp::ExhaustiveSolver(f);
  auto sols = solver.search({{"best_energy_sols", 1}});
  for (size_t k = 0; k < sols.size(); k++) {
    const auto& sol = sols[k];
    std::cout << "Solution " << k << " : " << sol(x) << std::endl;
  }
}
```
{% endraw %}

In this program, **`qbpp::var("x",4,4)`** returns a $4\times 4$ array of `Var`
named **`x`**.
For a `qbpp::Expr` object **`f`**, two double for-loops adds
formulas for $f(X)$.
Using the Exhaustive Solver, all optimal solutions are computed and stored in **`sols`**.
All solutions in `sols` are displayed one-by-one.
Here, `sol(x)` returns a matrix of values of `x` in `sol`.
This program outputs all 24 permutations as follows:
{% raw %}
```cpp
Solution 0 : {{0,0,0,1},{0,0,1,0},{0,1,0,0},{1,0,0,0}}
Solution 1 : {{0,0,0,1},{0,0,1,0},{1,0,0,0},{0,1,0,0}}

Solution 9 : {{0,0,1,0},{0,1,0,0},{1,0,0,0},{0,0,0,1}}
Solution 10 : {{0,0,1,0},{1,0,0,0},{0,0,0,1},{0,1,0,0}}
Solution 11 : {{0,0,1,0},{1,0,0,0},{0,1,0,0},{0,0,0,1}}
Solution 12 : {{0,1,0,0},{0,0,0,1},{0,0,1,0},{1,0,0,0}}
Solution 13 : {{0,1,0,0},{0,0,0,1},{1,0,0,0},{0,0,1,0}}
Solution 14 : {{0,1,0,0},{0,0,1,0},{0,0,0,1},{1,0,0,0}}
Solution 15 : {{0,1,0,0},{0,0,1,0},{1,0,0,0},{0,0,0,1}}
Solution 16 : {{0,1,0,0},{1,0,0,0},{0,0,0,1},{0,0,1,0}}
Solution 17 : {{0,1,0,0},{1,0,0,0},{0,0,1,0},{0,0,0,1}}
Solution 18 : {{1,0,0,0},{0,0,0,1},{0,0,1,0},{0,1,0,0}}
Solution 19 : {{1,0,0,0},{0,0,0,1},{0,1,0,0},{0,0,1,0}}
Solution 20 : {{1,0,0,0},{0,0,1,0},{0,0,0,1},{0,1,0,0}}
Solution 21 : {{1,0,0,0},{0,0,1,0},{0,1,0,0},{0,0,0,1}}
Solution 22 : {{1,0,0,0},{0,1,0,0},{0,0,0,1},{0,0,1,0}}
Solution 23 : {{1,0,0,0},{0,1,0,0},{0,0,1,0},{0,0,0,1}}
```

> **NOTE**

## QUBO formulation for a permutation matrix using array functions and operations
Using `qbpp::vector_sum()`, we can compute the row-wise and column-wise sums of a matrix `x` of binary variables:
- **`qbpp::vector_sum(x, 1)`**: Computes the sum of each row of `x` and returns an array of size `n` containing these sums.
- **`qbpp::vector_sum(x, 0)`**: Computes the sum of each column of `x` and returns an array of size `n` containing these sums.

> **Note**:
> For a multi-dimensional array `x` and an axis `k`, `qbpp::vector_sum(x, k)` computes sums along axis `k` and returns a multi-dimensional array whose dimension is reduced by one.
> For a 2-dimensional array (matrix) `x`, axis `1` corresponds to the row direction, and axis `0` corresponds to the column direction.

A scalar-array operation can be used to subtract 1 from each element:
- **`qbpp::vector_sum(x, 1) - 1`**: subtracts 1 from each row-wise sum.
- **`qbpp::vector_sum(x, 0) - 1`**: subtracts 1 from each column-wise sum.

For these two arrays of size `n`, `qbpp::sqr()` squares each element, and `qbpp::sum()` computes the sum of all elements.

The following QUBO++ program implements a QUBO formulation using these array functions and operations:
{% raw %}
```cpp
#include <qbpp/qbpp.hpp>
#include <qbpp/exhaustive_solver.hpp>

int main() {
  auto x = qbpp::var("x", 4, 4);
  auto f = qbpp::sum(qbpp::sqr(qbpp::vector_sum(x, 1) - 1)) +
           qbpp::sum(qbpp::sqr(qbpp::vector_sum(x, 0) - 1));
  f.simplify_as_binary();
  auto solver = qbpp::ExhaustiveSolver(f);
  auto sols = solver.search({{"best_energy_sols", 1}});
  for (size_t k = 0; k < sols.size(); k++) {
    const auto& sol = sols[k];
    const auto& row = qbpp::onehot_to_int(x(sol), 1);
    const auto& column = qbpp::onehot_to_int(x(sol), 0);
    std::cout << "Solution " << k << ": " << row << ", " << column << std::endl;
  }
}
```
{% endraw %}
In this program, `x(sol)` returns a matrix of assigned values to `x` in `sol`, which is a matrix of integers of size
.
`qbpp::onehot_to_int()` converts one-hot arrays along the axis to the corresponding integers.
- **`qbpp::onehot_to_int(x(sol), 1)`**: Computes the integer corresponding to each row and returns them as an array of 4 integers, which represents the permutation.
- **`qbpp::onehot_to_int(x(sol), 0)`**: returns the integer corresponding to each column and returns them as an array of 4 integers, which represents the inverse of the permutation.
This program outputs all permutations and their inverse as integer vectors as follows:
```
Solution 0: {3,2,1,0}, {3,2,1,0}
Solution 1: {3,2,0,1}, {2,3,1,0}
Solution 2: {3,1,2,0}, {3,1,2,0}
Solution 3: {3,1,0,2}, {2,1,3,0}
Solution 4: {3,0,2,1}, {1,3,2,0}
Solution 5: {3,0,1,2}, {1,2,3,0}
Solution 6: {2,3,1,0}, {3,2,0,1}
Solution 7: {2,3,0,1}, {2,3,0,1}
Solution 8: {2,1,3,0}, {3,1,0,2}
Solution 9: {2,1,0,3}, {2,1,0,3}
Solution 10: {2,0,3,1}, {1,3,0,2}
Solution 11: {2,0,1,3}, {1,2,0,3}
Solution 12: {1,3,2,0}, {3,0,2,1}
Solution 13: {1,3,0,2}, {2,0,3,1}
Solution 14: {1,2,3,0}, {3,0,1,2}
Solution 15: {1,2,0,3}, {2,0,1,3}
Solution 16: {1,0,3,2}, {1,0,3,2}
Solution 17: {1,0,2,3}, {1,0,2,3}
Solution 18: {0,3,2,1}, {0,3,2,1}
Solution 19: {0,3,1,2}, {0,2,3,1}
Solution 20: {0,2,3,1}, {0,3,1,2}
Solution 21: {0,2,1,3}, {0,2,1,3}
Solution 22: {0,1,3,2}, {0,1,3,2}
Solution 23: {0,1,2,3}, {0,1,2,3}
```

## Assignment problem and its QUBO formulation
Let $C = (c_{i,j})$ be a cost matrix of size $n \times n$.
The **assignment problem** for $C$ is to find a permutation
$p:\lbrace 0,1,\ldots, n-1\rbrace \rightarrow \lbrace 0,1,\ldots, n-1\rbrace$
that minimizes the total cost:

$$
\begin{aligned}
 g(p) &= \sum_{i=0}^{n-1}c_{i,p(i)}
\end{aligned}
$$

We can use a permutation matrix $X = (x_{i,j})$ of size $n \times n$ for a QUBO formulation of this problem by defining:

$$
\begin{aligned}
 g(X) &= \sum_{i=0}^{n-1}\sum_{j=0}^{n-1}c_{i,j}x_{i,j}
\end{aligned}
$$

Clearly, $g(p) = g(X)$ holds if and only if $X$ represents the permutation $p$.

We combine the QUBO formulation for the permutation matrix, $f(X)$, and the total cost, $g(X)$, to obtain a QUBO formulation of the assignment problem:

$$
\begin{aligned}
 h(X) &= P\cdot f(x)+g(x) \\
     &=P\left(\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}\left(1-\sum_{j=0}^{n-1}x_{i,j}\right)^2+\sum_{j=0}^{n-1}\left(1-\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}x_{i,j}\right)^2\right)+\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}\sum_{j=0}^{n-1}c_{i,j}x_{i,j}
\end{aligned}
$$

Here, $P$ is a sufficiently large positive constant that prioritizes the permutation constraints encoded in $f(X)$.

## QUBO++ program for the assignment problem
We are now ready to design a QUBO++ program for the assignment problem.
In this program, a fixed matrix $C$ of size $4\times4$ is given as an array of integer constants.
The formulas for $f(X)$ and $g(X)$ are defined using array functions and operations.
Here, `qbpp::vector_sum(x, 1) == 1` returns a QUBO expression that takes the minimum value 0 if the equality is satisfied.
In fact, it returns the same QUBO expression as `qbpp::sqr(qbpp::vector_sum(x, 1) - 1)`.
Also, `c * x` returns a matrix obtained by computing the element-wise product of `c` and `x`,
and therefore `qbpp::sum(c * x)` returns `g(X)`.

{% raw %}
```cpp
#include <qbpp/qbpp.hpp>
#include <qbpp/easy_solver.hpp>

int main() {
  auto c = qbpp::array({{58, 73, 91, 44}, {62, 15, 87, 39}, {78, 56, 23, 94}, {11, 85, 68, 72}});
  auto x = qbpp::var("x", 4, 4);
  auto f = qbpp::sum(qbpp::vector_sum(x, 1) == 1) +
           qbpp::sum(qbpp::vector_sum(x, 0) == 1);
  auto g = qbpp::sum(c * x);
  auto h = 1000 * f + g;
  h.simplify_as_binary();

  auto solver = qbpp::EasySolver(h);
  auto sol = solver.search({{"time_limit", 1.0}});
  std::cout << "sol = " << sol << std::endl;
  auto result = qbpp::onehot_to_int(x(sol), 1);
  std::cout << "Result : " << result << std::endl;
  for (size_t i = 0; i < result.size(); ++i) {
    std::cout << "c[" << i << "][" << result[i] << "] = " << c[i][result[i]]
              << std::endl;
  }
}
```
{% endraw %}

We use the Easy Solver to find a solution of `h`.
For an Easy Solver object `solver` for `h`, the time limit for searching a solution is set to 1.0 seconds by passing {% raw %}`{{"time_limit", 1.0}}`{% endraw %} to `search()`.
The resulting permutation is stored in `result`, and the selected `c[i][j]` values are printed in turn.
The output of this program is as follows:

{% raw %}
```
sol = 93:{{x[0][0],0},{x[0][1],0},{x[0][2],0},{x[0][3],1},{x[1][0],0},{x[1][1],1},{x[1][2],0},{x[1][3],0},{x[2][0],0},{x[2][1],0},{x[2][2],1},{x[2][3],0},{x[3][0],1},{x[3][1],0},{x[3][2],0},{x[3][3],0}}
Result : {3,1,2,0}
c[0][3] = 44
c[1][1] = 15
c[2][2] = 23
c[3][0] = 11
```
{% endraw %}
> **NOTE**
> For an expression `f` and an integer `m`, `f == m` returns an expression `qbpp::sqr(f - m)`,
> which takes the minimum value 0 if and only if the equality `f == m` is satisfied.
