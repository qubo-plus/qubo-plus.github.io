# Interval Subset Sum Problem (ISSP)
The **Interval Subset Sum Problem (ISSP)** is a generalization of the **Subset Sum Problem**.
Given $n$ integer **intervals $[l_i, u_i]$** $(0\leq i\leq n-1)$ and an **upper bound $T$**, the goal is to choose an integer value

$$
\begin{aligned}
v_i &\in \lbrace 0\rbrace \cup [l_i, u_i] && (i = 0,1,\dots,n-1),
\end{aligned}
$$

so as to satisfy the constraint

$$
\begin{aligned}
 \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} v_i \leq T,
\end{aligned}
$$

and maximize the objective:

$$
\begin{aligned}
 \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} v_i.
\end{aligned}
$$

## HUBO formulation of the ISPP
An integer variable can be represented by multiple binary variables using a binary encoding.
In QUBO++, such integer variables can be defined easily as shown in
[Integer Variables and Solving Simultaneous Equations](INTEGER).

Let $v_i$ $(0\leq i\leq n-1)$ be an integer variable that can take a value in $[l_i, u_i]$.
We also introduce a binary variable $s_i$  $(0\leq i\leq n-1)$ such that $s_i=1$ if and only if
interval $i$ is selected.

To model ISSP, we use the product $s_i v_i$ as the selected value:

$$
\begin{aligned}
s_iv_i &= 0 && \text{if } s_i= 0\\
       &\in [l_i,u_i] && \text{if } s_i= 1
\end{aligned}
$$

Let

$$
\begin{aligned}
\text{sum} &= \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} s_i v_i .
\end{aligned}
$$

In QUBO++, we impose this inequality constraint via a penalty term:

$$
\begin{aligned}
 \text{constraint} &= \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} \bigr(0\leq s_iv_i \leq T\bigl) \\
                &= (T-\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} s_iv_i)^2
\end{aligned}
$$

Since $s_i v_i$ is quadratic in binary variables, $\text{sum}$ is quadratic and $\text{constraint}$ becomes quartic.

Because the ISSP maximizes the sum under the upper bound $T$, we minimize the negative sum:

$$
\begin{aligned}
 \text{objective} &= -\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} s_iv_i
\end{aligned}
$$

Finally, we combine the objective and the constraint penalty into a single HUBO function:

$$
\begin{aligned}
f &= \text{objective} + P\times\text{constraint},
\end{aligned}
$$

where $P$ is a sufficiently large constant to prioritize feasibility.

## QUBO++ program of the HUBO formulation
The following QUBO++ program solves an ISSP instance with 8 intervals.
The lower and upper bounds $[l_i,u_i]$ are stored in the arrays `lower` and `upper`, and $T=100$.

{% raw %}
```cpp
#include <qbpp/qbpp.hpp>
#include <qbpp/easy_solver.hpp>

int main() {
  auto lower = qbpp::int_array({18, 17, 21, 18, 20, 14, 14, 23});
  auto upper = qbpp::int_array({19, 17, 22, 19, 20, 16, 15, 25});
  const int T = 100;

  auto v = lower <= qbpp::var_int("v", lower.size()) <= upper;
  auto s = qbpp::var("s", lower.size());

  auto sum = qbpp::sum(v * s);
  auto constraint = 0 <= sum <= T;
  auto f = -sum + 1000 * constraint;
  f.simplify_as_binary();

  auto solver = qbpp::easy_solver::EasySolver(f);
  auto sol = solver.search({{"target_energy", std::to_string(-T)}});
  for (size_t i = 0; i < v.size(); ++i) {
    if (sol(s[i])) {
      std::cout << "Interval " << i << ": val = " << sol(v[i]) << std::endl;
    }
  }
  std::cout << "sum = " << sol(sum) << std::endl;
}
```
{% endraw %}
First, we define an array `v` of integer variables where each `v[i]` takes an integer value in
`[lower[i], upper[i]]`.
We also define an array `s` of binary variables, where `s[i] = 1` means
interval `i` is selected.
The expression `sum` represents $\sum_i v_i s_i$.

The inequality constraint `0 <= sum <= T` is stored in `constraint`. In QUBO++, such a constraint
is internally converted into a nonnegative penalty term that becomes zero when the constraint is satisfied.

Finally, we construct the HUBO objective function `f` as
`f = -sum + P * constraint` (with `P = 1000` in this example).
Minimizing `f` therefore maximizes `sum` while heavily penalizing any violation of the constraint.

We set the target energy to `-T` because if the solver finds a feasible solution with `sum = T`,
then the penalty term is zero and the objective term becomes `-T`, i.e., the global minimum reaches `-T`.

For the obtained solution, the selected intervals and their values are printed. For example:
```
Interval 0: val = 18
Interval 1: val = 17
Interval 2: val = 22
Interval 4: val = 20
Interval 7: val = 23
sum = 100
```
This output confirms that a feasible solution achieving the maximum possible `sum` ($=T$) was obtained.

## QUBO formulation for the ISSP
The HUBO formulation above contains quartic terms because it uses products $s_i v_i$.
We can avoid quartic terms by introducing auxiliary integer variables.

Let $a_i$ $(0\leq i\leq n-1)$ be an integer variable that can take a value in
$[0,\, u_i-l_i]$.
We also use a binary variable $s_i$ $(0\leq i\leq n-1$) such that $s_i=1$ if and only if
interval $i$ is selected

We define

$$
\begin{aligned}
  v_i &= l_is_i + a_i && (0\leq i\leq n-1) \\
\end{aligned}
$$

To ensure that $v_i$ becomes 0 when $s_i=0$, we add the following penalty term using the negated literal $\overline{s_i}$:

$$
\begin{aligned}
  \text{constraint1} &= \sum_{i=0}^{n-1}\sum_j \overline{s_i}\,a_i
\end{aligned}
$$

Since $a_i \ge 0$ and $\overline{s_i} \ge 0$, we have $\text{constraint1}\ge 0$.
Moreover, $\text{constraint1}=0$ holds if and only if $a_i=0$ whenever $s_i=0$.
Therefore, the selected value $v_i$ satisfies

$$
\begin{aligned}
  v_i & = 0 && \text{if } s_i=0,\\
      & \in  [l_i,u_i] &&\text{if } s_i=1.
\end{aligned}
$$

because $v_i = l_i + a_i$ and $a_i \in [0,u_i-l_i]$ when $s_i=1$.

Let

$$
\begin{aligned}
\text{sum} &= \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} x_i.
\end{aligned}
$$

The ISSP constraint is:

$$
\begin{aligned}
 \text{constraint2} &= \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} \bigr(0\leq v_i \leq T\bigl) \\
                &= (T-\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} v_i)^2
\end{aligned}
$$

Finally, since ISSP maximizes $\text{sum}$ under the upper bound $T$, we minimize

$$
\begin{aligned}
 \text{objective} &= -\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} v_i
\end{aligned}
$$

Combining the objective and the penalties, we obtain the QUBO expression:

$$
\begin{aligned}
f &= \text{objective} + P\times(\text{constraint1}+\text{constraint2}),
\end{aligned}
$$

where $P$ is a sufficiently large constant to prioritize feasibility.

## QUBO++ program of the QUBO formulation
The following QUBO++ program solves the same ISSP instance using the QUBO formulation:
{% raw %}
```cpp
#include <qbpp/qbpp.hpp>
#include <qbpp/easy_solver.hpp>

int main() {
  auto lower = qbpp::int_array({18, 17, 21, 18, 20, 14, 14, 23});
  auto upper = qbpp::int_array({19, 17, 22, 19, 20, 16, 15, 25});
  const int T = 100;

  auto a = 0 <= qbpp::var_int("a", lower.size()) <= (upper - lower);
  auto s = qbpp::var("s", lower.size());
  auto v = s * lower + a;

  auto sum = qbpp::sum(v);
  auto constraint1 = qbpp::sum(~s * a);
  auto constraint2 = 0 <= sum <= T;
  auto f = -sum + 1000 * (constraint1 + constraint2);
  f.simplify_as_binary();

  auto solver = qbpp::easy_solver::EasySolver(f);
  auto sol = solver.search({{"target_energy", std::to_string(-T)}});
  for (size_t i = 0; i < v.size(); ++i) {
    if (sol(s[i])) {
      std::cout << "Interval " << i << ": val = " << (sol(v[i])) << std::endl;
    }
  }
  std::cout << "sum = " << sol(sum) << std::endl;
}
```
{% endraw %}
First, we define an array `a` of integer variables, where each `a[i]` takes an integer value in
`[0, upper[i] - lower[i]]`.
We also define an array `s` of binary variables.
Using `a` and `s`, we construct `x = s * lower + a`, which corresponds to
$v_i = s_i * l_i+a_i$.
The expression `constraint1 = sum(~s * a)` penalizes any solution with `a[i] > 0` when `s[i] = 0`,
thereby enforcing `v[i] = 0` for unselected intervals.
The inequality constraint `constraint2 = 0 <= sum <= T`
ensures that the total selected sum does not exceed `T`.

Finally, we minimize `f = -sum + P * (constraint1 + constraint2)` with a sufficiently large penalty constant `P`.
As in the previous example, passing {% raw %}`{{"target_energy", std::to_string(-T)}}`{% endraw %} to `search()` allows the solver to stop early if it finds a feasible solution achieving `sum = T` (in which case the penalty terms are zero and the objective term becomes `-T`).
