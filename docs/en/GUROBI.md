# Gurobi Optimizer Usage

QUBO++ can use the Gurobi Optimizer to solve QUBO expressions.
To use the Gurobi Optimizer, you must have a valid Gurobi license.

Solving a problem using the Gurobi Optimizer consists of the following three steps:
1. Create a Gurobi model object (i.e., **`qbpp::grb::QuboModel`**).
2. Set solver options by calling member functions of the Gurobi model object.
3. Search for a solution by calling the **`optimize()`** member function, which returns a solution (a `qbpp::Sol` object).

## Creating Gurobi model object
To use the Gurobi Optimizer, a Gurobi model object (i.e., **`qbpp::grb::QuboModel`**) is constructed with an expression (`qbpp::Expr`) as follows:
- **`qbpp::grb::QuboModel(const qbpp::Expr& f)`**

Here, `f` is the expression to be solved.

## Setting Gurobi options
For a created Gurobi model object, the following member functions can be used to specify solver options:
- **`set(key, val)`:**
Sets the Gurobi parameter specified by key to val.
Both key and val must be strings.
- **`time_limit(time_limit)`**:
Sets the time limit in seconds.
Internally, this calls
`set("TimeLimit", std::to_string(time_limit))`.

For a complete list of available parameters, refer to the following Gurobi documentation:
https://docs.gurobi.com/projects/optimizer/en/current/reference/parameters.html

## Searching solutions
The Gurobi Optimizer searches for a solution by calling the **`optimize()`** member function of the Gurobi model object.
The `optimize()` function returns a solution object, which is a derived class of `qbpp::Sol`.
The member function **`bound()`** returns the best bound obtained during optimization.

## Sample program
The following program searches for a solution to the partitioning problem using the Gurobi Optimizer:
```cpp
#include <qbpp/qbpp.hpp>
#include <qbpp/grb.hpp>

int main() {
  std::vector<uint32_t> w = {64, 27, 47, 74, 12, 83, 63, 40};
  auto x = qbpp::var("x", w.size());
  auto p = qbpp::expr();
  auto q = qbpp::expr();
  for (size_t i = 0; i < w.size(); ++i) {
    p += w[i] * x[i];
    q += w[i] * (1 - x[i]);
  }
  auto f = qbpp::sqr(p - q);
  f.simplify_as_binary();
  auto model = qbpp::grb::QuboModel(f);
  model.time_limit(10.0);
  auto sol = model.optimize();
  std::cout << "Solution: " << sol << std::endl;
  std::cout << "Bound = " << sol.bound() << std::endl;
  std::cout << "f(sol) = " << f(sol) << std::endl;
  std::cout << "p(sol) = " << p(sol) << std::endl;
  std::cout << "q(sol) = " << q(sol) << std::endl;
  std::cout << "P :";
  for (size_t i = 0; i < w.size(); ++i) {
    if (x[i](sol) == 1) {
      std::cout << " " << w[i];
    }
  }
  std::cout << std::endl;
  std::cout << "Q :";
  for (size_t i = 0; i < w.size(); ++i) {
    if (x[i](sol) == 0) {
      std::cout << " " << w[i];
    }
  }
  std::cout << std::endl;
}
```
First, this program creates a Gurobi model for the expression `f`, which represents the partitioning problem.
The time limit is set to 10.0 seconds, and then `optimize()` is called.
The obtained solution is stored in `sol`.

This program produces the following output:
{% raw %}
```
Solution: 0:{{x[0],1},{x[1],1},{x[2],0},{x[3],1},{x[4],0},{x[5],0},{x[6],0},{x[7],1}}
Bound = 0
f(sol) = 0
p(sol) = 205
q(sol) = 205
P : 64 27 74 40
Q : 47 12 83 63
```
{% endraw %}
Since the solution value and the bound have the same energy 0
the obtained solution is guaranteed to be optimal.
