# Minimum Vertex Cover Problem
A **vertex cover** of an undirected graph $G=(V,E)$ is a subset
$S\subseteq V$ such that, for every edge $(u,v)\in E$, at least one of its endpoints belongs to $S$.
The **minimum vertex cover problem** is to find a vertex cover with minimum cardinality.

We can formulate this problem as a QUBO expression.
For an $n$-node graph $G=(V,E)$ whose nodes are labeled $0,1,\ldots,n−1$,
we introduce $n$ binary variables $x_0,x_1,\ldots, x_{n-1}$, where $x_i=1$ if and only if node
$i$ is selected (i.e., $i\in S$).

Using negated literals $\overline{x}_i$ (where $\overline{x}_i=1$ iff $x_i=0$),
we define the following penalty term, which becomes 0 if and only if every edge is covered:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\text{constraint} &= \sum_{(i,j)\in E} \overline{x}_i\,\overline{x}_j
\end{aligned}
$$

For an edge $(i,j)$, the product $\overline{x}_i\,\overline{x}_j$ equals 1 only when neither endpoint is selected, meaning the edge is uncovered. Therefore, the sum counts the number of uncovered edges.

Equivalently, since the condition $1\leq x_i+x_j\leq 2$ means that one or both endpoints are selected, we can write a QUBO++-style formulation as:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\text{constraint'} &= \sum_{(i,j)\in E} (1\leq x_i+x_j\leq 2)
\end{aligned}
$$

The objective is to minimize the number of selected vertices:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\text{objective} &= \sum_{i=0}^{n-1}x_i
\end{aligned}
$$

Finally, the QUBO expression $f$ is given by:

$$
\begin{aligned}
f &= \text{objective} + 2\times \text{constraint}, \text{or}\\
  &= \text{objective} + \text{constraint'}
\end{aligned}
$$

The penalty coefficient 2 is used to prioritize satisfying the constraint over minimizing the objective.

## QUBO++ program for the minimum vertex cover problem
The following QUBO++ program solves the minimum vertex cover problem for a graph with $N=16$ nodes:

{% raw %}
```cpp
#include <qbpp/qbpp.hpp>
#include <qbpp/exhaustive_solver.hpp>
#include <qbpp/graph.hpp>

int main() {
  const size_t N = 16;
  std::vector<std::pair<size_t, size_t>> edges = {
      {0, 1},   {0, 2},   {1, 3},   {1, 4},   {2, 5},  {2, 6},
      {3, 7},   {3, 13},  {4, 6},   {4, 7},   {5, 8},  {6, 8},
      {6, 14},  {7, 14},  {8, 9},   {9, 10},  {9, 12}, {10, 11},
      {10, 12}, {11, 13}, {12, 14}, {13, 15}, {14, 15}};

  auto x = qbpp::var("x", N);

  auto objective = qbpp::sum(x);
  auto constraint = qbpp::toExpr(0);
  for (const auto& e : edges) {
    constraint += ~x[e.first] * ~x[e.second];
  }
  auto f = objective + constraint * 2;
  f.simplify_as_binary();

  auto solver = qbpp::exhaustive_solver::ExhaustiveSolver(f);
  auto sol = solver.search();

  std::cout << "objective = " << objective(sol) << std::endl;
  std::cout << "constraint = " << constraint(sol) << std::endl;

  qbpp::graph::GraphDrawer graph;
  for (size_t i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
    graph.add_node(qbpp::graph::Node(i).color(sol(x[i])));
  }
  for (const auto& e : edges) {
    graph.add_edge(qbpp::graph::Edge(e.first, e.second));
  }
  graph.write("vertexcover.svg");
}
```
{% endraw %}
In this program, `objective`, `constraint`, and `f` are constructed according to the formulation above.
The Exhaustive Solver is applied to `f` to search for an optimal solution.
The obtained solution `sol` is visualized and saved as `vertexcover.svg`.

This program prints the following output:
```cpp
objective = 9
constraint = 0
```
An optimal solution with objective value 9 and constraint value 0 is obtained.
The resulting image, which highlights the selected vertices, is shown below:
