# Quick Reference: Variables and Expressions

## Data types used in `qbpp::Expr`
- **`coeff_t`**:
  The integer data type used for coefficients in `qbpp::Term` objects.
  The default type is `int32_t`.
  To change this type, define the `COEFF_TYPE` macro at compile time, for example:
```
-DCOEFF_TYPE=int64_t
```
- **`energy_t`**:
The integer data type used to compute energy values of `qbpp::Expr` objects,
as well as for integer constant terms in `qbpp::Expr`.
The default type is `int64_t`.
To change this type, define the `ENERGY_TYPE` macro at compile time, for example:
```
-DENERGY_TYPE=int32_t
```
The bit width of `energy_t` is guaranteed to be equal to or larger than that of `coeff_t`.

- **`vindex_t`**:
Defined as `uint32_t` and used to store a unique integer ID for each `qbpp::Var` object.
In most cases, it is not necessary to change this data type.

## Available integer data types
- **Standard integer types**:
`int32_t`, `int64_t`

- **Multiprecision integer types** (implemented using the Boost.Multiprecision library):
`qbpp::int128_t`, `qbpp::cpp_int`

- **`qbpp::cpp_int`**:
An integer type with unlimited precision.

> **WARNING**
> To maximize performance, QUBO++ does not check for arithmetic overflow.
> During development and testing, it is recommended to use wider bit widths for
> `coeff_t` and `energy_t`.
> If the required bit widths are unclear, use `qbpp::cpp_int` to ensure correctness,
> and switch to fixed-width integer types after validation.

## Printing class objects
Most classes in QUBO++ can be printed using the `<<` operator with `std::ostream`,
which is useful for debugging.
For example, an object `obj` in QUBO++ can be printed to `std::cout` as follows:
```cpp
std::cout << obj << std::endl;
```
This invokes either `obj.str()` or `str(obj)`, which returns a std::string
containing a textual representation of obj.
This design allows easy inspection of internal states without relying on a debugger.


## Variable classes
- **`qbpp::Var`**:
  A class that holds a unique 32-bit integer ID.
  The variable name is stored in a global registry and can be retrieved via `x.str()`.


> **NOTE**
> A `qbpp::Var` object represents a variable symbolically.
> No specific data type is associated with it.
> It can be used to represent binary, spin, or other types of variables.

### Variable creation functions
The following functions are provided to create variables:

- **`qbpp::var("name")`**:
  Creates a `qbpp::Var` object with the given name `"name"`.

- **`qbpp::var("name", s1)`**:
  Creates a one-dimensional array of `qbpp::Var` objects with the base name `"name"`.
  Each element is represented as `name[i]`.
  The resulting type is `qbpp::Array<1, qbpp::Var>`.

- **`qbpp::var("name", s1, s2)`**:
  Creates a two-dimensional array (matrix) of `qbpp::Var` objects with the base name `"name"`.
  Each element is represented as `name[i][j]`.
  The resulting type is `qbpp::Array<2, qbpp::Var>`.

- **`qbpp::var("name", s1, s2, ...)`**:
  Creates a higher-dimensional array of `qbpp::Var` objects with the base name `"name"`.
  Each element is represented as `name[i][j]...`.
  The resulting type is `qbpp::Array<N, qbpp::Var>` where `N` is the number of dimensions.

> **NOTE**
> If `"name"` is omitted, numbered names such as `"{0}"`, `"{1}"`, ... are automatically assigned in creation order.

## `qbpp::Var` member functions
For a `qbpp::Var` instance `x`, the following member functions are available:

- **`std::string x.str()`**:
  Returns the name of `x`.

- **`vindex_t x.index()`**:
  Returns the unique integer ID of `x`.

Usually, there is no need to call these member functions explicitly in QUBO++ programs.

## Integer variable class
- **`qbpp::VarInt`**:
  A class derived from `qbpp::Expr` that represents an integer variable with a specified range.

### Integer variable creation functions
The following functions are provided to create integer variables:

- **`qbpp::var_int("name")`**:
  Returns an internally used helper object and does not create a `qbpp::VarInt` by itself.
  To define a `qbpp::VarInt`, the range must be specified using the `<=` operator, as shown below.

- **`l <= qbpp::var_int("name") <= u`**:
  Here, `l` and `u` must be integers.
  This expression creates a `qbpp::VarInt` object with the name `"name"`,
  which internally contains a `qbpp::Expr` object representing all integers in the range `[l, u]`.
  Internally, this also creates `qbpp::Var` objects used in the underlying expression.

- **`l <= qbpp::var_int("name", s1) <= u`**:
  Creates a one-dimensional array (vector) of `qbpp::VarInt` objects with the base name `"name"`
  and the same range `[l, u]`.
  Each element is represented as `name[i]`.
  The resulting type is `qbpp::Array<1, qbpp::VarInt>`.
  Higher-dimensional arrays (e.g., `qbpp::Array<2, qbpp::VarInt>`) can be created in the same way as `qbpp::Var` objects.

### Integer variable member functions
For a `qbpp::VarInt` instance `x`, the following member functions are available:

- **`std::string x.name()`**:
  Returns the name of `x`.

- **`std::string x.str()`**:
  Returns the string representation of the underlying expression.

- **`energy_t x.min_val`**:
  Returns the minimum value `l` of `x`.

- **`energy_t x.max_val`**:
  Returns the maximum value `u` of `x`.

- **`x.vars`**:
  Returns the `qbpp::Var` object array used to represent the integer variable.

- **`x.coeffs`**:
  Returns the integer coefficient array.

The following expression is equivalent to the expression stored in `x`:
```cpp
x.min_val + qbpp::sum(x.coeffs * x.vars)
```
