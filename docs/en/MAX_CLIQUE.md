# Maximum Clique  Problem

Given an undirected graph $G=(V,E)$, the Maximum Clique problem aims to find a largest subset
$S\subseteq V$ such that every pair of distinct vertices in $S$ is connected by an edge in $E$.

Assume that the vertices are labeled $0,1,\ldots,n−1$.
We introduce $n$ binary variables $x_0, x_1, \ldots, x_{n-1}$,
where $x_i=1$ if and only if node $i$ belongs to $S$ ($0\leq i\leq n−1$).
Then, the size of $S$ is given by

$$
\begin{aligned}
\text{objective} &= \sum_{i=0}^{n-1}x_i.
\end{aligned}
$$

For $S$ to be a clique, every pair of selected nodes must be connected by an edge.
Equivalently, for every pair of nodes $i$ and $j$ such that
$(i,j)\not\in E$ we cannot select both $i$ and $j$.
This can be expressed by the constraint:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\text{constraint} &= \sum_{(i,j)\not\in E}x_ix_j
\end{aligned}
$$

A feasible clique satisfies $constraint=0$.
Thus, we obtain the following QUBO formulation $f$ (to be minimized):

$$
\begin{aligned}
f &= -\text{objective}+2\times \text{constraint}
\end{aligned}
$$

where 2 is a penalty coefficient.

The optimal solution minimizing $f$ corresponds to a maximum clique, and the objective value equals the number of selected nodes.

## QUBO++ problem for the maximum clique problem
Based on the formulation above, the following QUBO++ program constructs the QUBO expression $f$ for a 16-node graph and solves it using the Exhaustive Solver:

```cpp
#include <qbpp/qbpp.hpp>
#include <qbpp/exhaustive_solver.hpp>
#include <qbpp/graph.hpp>

int main() {
  const size_t N = 16;
  std::vector<std::pair<size_t, size_t>> edges = {
      {0, 1},   {0, 2},   {1, 3},   {1, 4},   {2, 5},   {2, 6},
      {3, 7},   {3, 13},  {4, 6},   {4, 7},   {4, 12},  {4, 14},
      {5, 8},   {6, 8},   {6, 12},  {6, 14},  {7, 14},  {7, 15},
      {8, 9},   {9, 10},  {9, 12},  {10, 11}, {10, 12}, {11, 13},
      {11, 15}, {12, 14}, {12, 15}, {13, 15}, {14, 15}};
  const size_t M = edges.size();

  std::vector<std::vector<bool>> adj(N, std::vector<bool>(N, false));
  for (auto [u, v] : edges) {
    adj[u][v] = adj[v][u] = true;
  }

  auto x = qbpp::var("x", N);

  auto objective = qbpp::sum(x);

  auto constraint = qbpp::Expr(0);
  for (size_t i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
    for (size_t j = i + 1; j < N; ++j) {
      if (!adj[i][j]) {
        constraint += x[i] * x[j];
      }
    }
  }

  auto f = -objective + N * constraint;
  f.simplify_as_binary();

  auto solver = qbpp::ExhaustiveSolver(f);
  auto sol = solver.search();

  std::cout << "objective = " << objective(sol) << std::endl;
  qbpp::graph::GraphDrawer graph;
  for (size_t i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
    graph.add_node(qbpp::graph::Node(i).color(sol(x[i])));
  }
  for (size_t i = 0; i < M; ++i) {
    auto edge = qbpp::graph::Edge(edges[i].first, edges[i].second);
    if (sol(x[edges[i].first]) && sol(x[edges[i].second])) {
      edge.color(1).penwidth(2.0);
    }
    graph.add_edge(edge);
  }
  graph.write("maxclique.svg");
}

```
From the edge list `edges`, we build an adjacency matrix `adj`, which allows us to test whether a given pair of nodes forms an edge in the graph.
For the vector `x` of `N = 16` binary variables, the expressions `objective`, `constraint`, and `f` are constructed according to the QUBO formulation above.
In particular, if `adj[i][j]` is false, the quadratic term `x[i] * x[j]` is added to `constraint`.

The Exhaustive Solver is then used to find an optimal solution minimizing `f`, which is stored in `sol`. The values of `objective` and `constraint` evaluated at `sol` are printed.

A `qbpp::graph::GraphDrawer` object `graph` is created so that the selected clique nodes and clique edges are highlighted.

This program produces the following output:
```
objective = 4
constraint = 0
```
From this output, we obtain a maximum clique of 4 nodes without violating the constraint.
The result is visualized in `maxclique.svg` as follows:
