# N-Queens Problem
The **8-Queens problem** aims to place 8 queens on a chessboard so that no two queens attack each other; that is, no two queens share the same row, the same column, or the same diagonal (in either direction).
The **N-Queens problem** generalizes this: place
$N$ queens on an $N\times N$ chessboard under the same conditions.

To formulate this problem using QUBO++, we use an $N\times N$ matrix $X=(x_{i,j})$ of binary variables, where
$x_{i,j}=1$ if a queen is placed at row $i$ and column $j$, and $x_{i,j}=0$ otherwise.
We impose the following constraints:
- Exactly one queen in each row:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\sum_{j=0}^{N-1} x_{i,j}&=1 && (0\leq i\leq N-1)
\end{aligned}
$$

- Exactly one queen in each column:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\sum_{i=0}^{N-1} x_{i,j}&=1 && (0\leq j\leq N-1)
\end{aligned}
$$

- At most one queen on each diagonal (from top-left to bottom-right):
A diagonal is characterized by $i+j=k$.
We consider only diagonals of length at least 2, i.e.,
$k=1,2,\ldots,2N−3$, and require:

$$
\begin{aligned}
0\leq \sum_{\substack{0\le i,j \le N-1\\ i+j=k}}x_{i,j}\leq 1 &&(1\leq k\leq 2N-3)
\end{aligned}
$$

- The sum of each anti-diagonal of $X$ is 0 or 1:
An anti-diagonal is characterized by $j−i=d$.
We consider only anti-diagonals of length at least 2, i.e.,
$d=−(N−2),\ldots,(N−2)$, and require:

$$
\begin{aligned}
0\leq \sum_{\substack{0\le i,j \le N-1\\ j-i=d}}x_{i,j}\leq 1 &&(-(N-2)\leq d\leq (N-2))
\end{aligned}
$$

## QUBO++ program
The following QUBO++ program constructs an expression representing the constraints above and then finds a feasible solution using the Easy Solver:
{% raw %}
```cpp
#include <qbpp/qbpp.hpp>
#include <qbpp/easy_solver.hpp>

int main() {
  const int n = 8;
  auto x = qbpp::var("x", n, n);

  auto f = qbpp::sum(qbpp::vector_sum(x, 0) == 1) +
           qbpp::sum(qbpp::vector_sum(x, 1) == 1);

  const int m = 2 * n - 3;
  auto a = qbpp::expr(m);
  auto b = qbpp::expr(m);

  for (int i = 0; i < m; ++i) {
    const int k = i + 1;
    for (int r = 0; r < n; ++r) {
      const int c = k - r;
      if (0 <= c && c < n) {
        a[static_cast<size_t>(i)] +=
            x[static_cast<size_t>(r)][static_cast<size_t>(c)];
      }
    }

    const int d = i - (n - 2);
    for (int r = 0; r < n; ++r) {
      const int c = r + d;
      if (0 <= c && c < n) {
        b[static_cast<size_t>(i)] +=
            x[static_cast<size_t>(r)][static_cast<size_t>(c)];
      }
    }
  }

  f += qbpp::sum(0 <= a <= 1);
  f += qbpp::sum(0 <= b <= 1);

  f.simplify_as_binary();

  auto solver = qbpp::easy_solver::EasySolver(f);
  auto sol = solver.search({{"target_energy", 0}});
  for (size_t i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    for (size_t j = 0; j < n; j++) {
      std::cout << (sol(x[i][j]) ? "Q" : ".");
    }
    std::cout << std::endl;
  }
}
```
{% endraw %}
An `n`$\times$`n` matrix `x` of binary variables is introduced, where `x[i][j] = 1` indicates that a queen is placed at row `i` and column `j`.
The column-wise sums are computed using `qbpp::vector_sum(x, 0)`, which returns a vector of `n` expressions (one per column).
Applying the `==` operator element-wise produces a vector of penalty expressions; each expression evaluates to 0 if and only if the corresponding column sum equals 1.
Similarly, we can enforce the row-wise one-hot constraints using `qbpp::vector_sum(x, 1)`.

To enforce diagonal constraints, we build two vectors of expressions, a and b, each of length `m = 2*n - 3`.
For each index `i`, `a[i]` accumulates variables on a diagonal with a fixed value of `r + c` (diagonals from top-left to bottom-right), excluding diagonals of length 1.
Similarly, `b[i]` accumulates variables on an anti-diagonal with a fixed value of `c - r` (diagonals from top-right to bottom-left), again excluding diagonals of length 1.
The chained range comparison `0 <= a <= 1` (and similarly for b) is applied element-wise and produces penalties that become 0 if and only if each diagonal/anti-diagonal contains at most one queen.
These penalties are added to `f`.

After converting the expression into a binary QUBO form with `f.simplify_as_binary()`, the Easy Solver searches for a solution with target energy 0.
The resulting assignment sol is then printed as an 8-by-8 board, where `Q` denotes a queen and `.` denotes an empty square.
For example, the program may produce the following output:
```
..Q.....
.....Q..
.......Q
.Q......
...Q....
Q.......
......Q.
....Q...
```
This output confirms a valid placement of eight queens, since no two queens share the same row, column, diagonal, or anti-diagonal.
