# Range Constraints and Solving Integer Linear Programming

## Polynomial formulation for range constraints
Let $f$ be a polynomial expression of binary variables.
A range constraint has the form **$l\leq f\leq u$** with $l<u$.
Our goal is to design a polynomial expression that takes the minimum value 0 if and only if the range constraint is satisfied.

The key idea is to introduce an **auxiliary integer variable** $a$ that takes values in the range $[l,u]$.
Consider the following expression:

$$
\begin{aligned}
g &= (f-a)^2
\end{aligned}
$$

This expression $g$ takes the minimum value 0 exactly when $f=a$.
Since $a$ can take any integer value in $[l,u]$, the expression
$g$ achieves 0 if and only if $f$ itself takes an integer value within the same range.

Using this auxiliary-variable technique, QUBO++ implements range constraints.
If $f$ is a linear expression, then $g$ becomes a QUBO expression.
If $f$ is cubic or of higher degree, then $g$ becomes a HUBO expression.

>**NOTE**
> QUBO++ internally employs a lightweight improvement that enables range constraints to be encoded with a slightly smaller number of binary variables.

## Solving Integer Linear Programming
An instance of **integer linear programming** consists of an **objective function** and multiple **linear constraints**.
For example, the following integer linear program has two variables, one objective, and two constraints:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\text{Maximize: } & & & 5x + 4y \\
\text{Subject to: } & && 2x + 3y \le 24 \\
                   & & & 7x + 5y \le 54
\end{aligned}
$$

The optimal solution of this problem is $x=4$, $y=5$, with the objective value $40$.

The following QUBO++ program finds this optimal solution using the Easy Solver:
{% raw %}
```cpp
#include <qbpp/qbpp.hpp>
#include <qbpp/easy_solver.hpp>

int main() {
  auto x = 0 <= qbpp::var_int("x") <= 10;
  auto y = 0 <= qbpp::var_int("y") <= 10;
  auto f = 5 * x + 4 * y;
  auto c1 = 0 <= 2 * x + 3 * y <= 24;
  auto c2 = 0 <= 7 * x + 5 * y <= 54;
  auto g = -f + 100 * (c1 + c2);
  g.simplify_as_binary();
  auto solver = qbpp::easy_solver::EasySolver(g);
  auto sol = solver.search({{"time_limit", 1.0}});
  std::cout << "x = " << sol(x) << ", y = " << sol(y) << std::endl;
  std::cout << "f = " << sol(f) << std::endl;
  std::cout << "c1 = " << sol(c1) << ", c2 = " << sol(c2) << std::endl;
  std::cout << "*c1 = " << sol(*c1) << ", *c2 = " << sol(*c2) << std::endl;
}
```
{% endraw %}

In this QUBO++ program,
- **`f`** represents the objective function,
- **`c1`** and **`c2`** represent the range constraints, and
- **`g`** combines them into a single optimization expression.

Since the goal is maximization, the objective is negated as `-f`.
The constraints `c1` and `c2` are penalized with a weight of 100 to ensure they are satisfied with high priority.

An Easy Solver instance is created for `g`, and a search is performed with a time limit of 1.0 seconds.
After obtaining the optimal solution `sol`, the program prints the values of `x`, `y`, `f`, `c1`, `c2`, `*c1`, and `*c2`.

The program outputs:
```
x = 4, y = 5
f = 40
c1 = 0, c2 = 0
*c1 = 23, *c2 = 53
```
Here,
- **`c1`** is the expression for the constraint `0 <= 2 x + 3 y <= 24`, and
- **`*c1`** represents the linear expression  `2 x + 3 y`.

We can confirm that the solver correctly finds the optimal solution.
