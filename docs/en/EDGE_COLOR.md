# Graph Edge Coloring Problem
Given an undirected graph $G=(V,E)$, the **graph edge coloring problem** aims to assign a color to each edge so that no two edges of the same color share a common endpoint.

More specifically, for a set $C$ of colors, the goal is to find an assignment
$\sigma:E\rightarrow C$ such that for any two distinct edges $𝑒$ and $e'$ incident to the same node, we have $\sigma(e)\neq \sigma(e')$.
Equivalently, for every node $u\in V$ and any two distinct neighbors $v\neq v'$
with $(u,v)\in E$ and $(u,v')\in E$ the following must hold:

$$
\sigma((u,v))\neq \sigma((u,v')).
$$


The graph edge coloring problem can be formulated easily as a QUBO expression.
Let $V=\lbrace 0,1,\ldots,n−1\rbrace$ and $C=\lbrace 0,1,\ldots,m−1\rbrace$.
We assign unique IDs $0,1,\ldots,e−1$ to the $e=∣E∣$ edges, and let $(u_i,v_i)$ denote the $i$-th edge.

We introduce an $e\times m$ matrix $X=(x_{i,j})$ of binary variables, where
$x_{i,j}=1$ if and only if edge $(u_i,v_i)$ is assigned color $j$.

### One-hot constraint
Since exactly one color must be assigned to each edge, each row of
$X$ must be one-hot:

$$
\begin{aligned}
  \text{onehot}&= \sum_{i=0}^{e-1}\bigr(\sum_{j=0}^{m-1}x_{i,j}==1\bigl)\\
   &=\sum_{i=0}^{e-1}\bigr(1-\sum_{j=0}^{m-1}x_{i,j}\bigl)^2
\end{aligned}
$$

### Incident edges must differ
For each node, any pair of distinct incident edges must not be assigned the same color. This can be penalized as follows:

$$
\begin{aligned}
  \text{different}&= \sum_{u\in V}\sum_{\substack{i<k\\ i,k\in I(u)}}x_u\cdot x_v\\
   &=\sum_{u\in V}\sum_{\substack{i<k\\ i,k\in I(u)}}\sum_{j=0}^{m-1}x_{u,j}x_{v,j}
\end{aligned}
$$

where $I(u)\subseteq \lbrace 0,1,\ldots,e−1\rbrace$ denotes the set of edge IDs incident to node $u$.

## QUBO objective
By combining these expressions, we obtain the QUBO objective function:

$$
\begin{aligned}
  f &= \text{onehot}+\text{different}
\end{aligned}
$$

This objective attains the minimum value 0 if and only if a valid
edge coloring of the graph exists.

## QUBO++ formulation
It is known that the edge chromatic number of a simple graph is either $\Delta$ or $\Delta+1$, where $\Delta$ is the maximum degree of the graph. The following QUBO++ program attempts to find an edge coloring of a graph with $n$ nodes and $s$ edges using $m=\Delta$ colors:

In this program, we first build the incidence list `adj`, where `adj[i]` stores the indices of edges incident to node `i`.
We then compute the maximum degree $\Delta$ and set `m=`$\Delta$.
Next, we define an `s`$\times$`m` matrix `x` of binary variables, where `x[i][j]=1` means that edge `i` is assigned color `j`.
We construct the expressions `onehot`, `different`, and `f` as follows:
- `onehot` enforces that each edge is assigned exactly one color.
- `different` penalizes pairs of edges that share an endpoint and are assigned the same color.
- `f = onehot + different` is the QUBO objective, which attains the minimum value 0 if and only if a valid `m`-edge-coloring is found.

We solve the resulting QUBO using the Easy Solver with target energy 0, and store the solution in `sol`. We then print the values of `onehot` and `different` evaluated at `sol`.

We also compute `edge_color`, which stores the color assigned to each edge, by applying `qbpp::onehot_to_int()` to `sol(x)`.
Finally, we draw the edge-colored graph using `qbpp::graph::GraphDrawer`, where edge `i` is colored with color number `edge_color[i] + 1`.

The function `qbpp::onehot_to_int()` returns a vector of integers in the range `[0,m−1]`, where each entry indicates the position of the 1 in the corresponding one-hot row. If a row is not a valid one-hot vector, the function returns $−1$ for that row. In this case, the edge color becomes $−1+1=0$, so the edge is drawn in color 0 (black).

This program produces the following output:
```
colors = 6
onehot = 0
different = 0
```
Therefore, a valid edge coloring using `m = 6` colors is found:
