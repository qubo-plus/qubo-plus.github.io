# License Management

This page describes how to manage your QUBO++ license using the **`qbpp-license`** command-line utility.
The license system is shared between **QUBO++ (C++)** and **PyQBPP (Python)**.

## License Types

QUBO++ offers several license types with different variable count limits and validity periods.

| License Type | Key Required | Validity | CPU Variables | GPU Variables |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Anonymous Trial** | No | 7 days | 1,000 | 1,000 |
| **Registered Trial** | Yes | 30 days | 10,000 | 10,000 |
| **Standard** | Yes | Agreement term | 2,147,483,647 | 1,000 |
| **Professional** | Yes | Agreement term | 2,147,483,647 | 2,147,483,647 |
| **Fallback** | N/A | Always | 100 | 100 |

- **Anonymous Trial**: No registration required. Automatically activated on first use.
- **Registered Trial**: Requires a free license key for evaluation purposes. [Apply here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd0SsTJE3TF435rPus256BKhM3-4pNougsA_85W3F4Oi_aOUQ/viewform).
- **Standard License**: For production use. Supports large-scale CPU optimization.
- **Professional License**: For production use with GPU acceleration (ABS3 Solver, Exhaustive Solver).
- **Fallback Mode**: When no valid license is found or the license has expired, QUBO++ runs with a 100-variable limit.

## Setting and Activating the License Key

If you have a license key, set it using one of the following methods.

### Method 1: Activate with `qbpp-license` (recommended)

Run the following command once per machine:

```bash
qbpp-license -k XXXXXX-XXXXXX-XXXXXX-XXXXXX -a
```

The license key is encrypted and cached locally. After activation, no environment variable or `-k` option is needed for subsequent runs — QUBO++ programs automatically use the cached key.

To re-activate or change the key, simply run the command again with a new key.

### Method 2: Environment Variable

Set the `QBPP_LICENSE_KEY` environment variable. This is useful for Docker/CI environments where the local cache is not persistent.

```bash
export QBPP_LICENSE_KEY=XXXXXX-XXXXXX-XXXXXX-XXXXXX
```

### Priority

When multiple methods are used, the following priority applies:

1. **`-k` argument** or `qbpp::license_key()` in code (highest)
2. **`QBPP_LICENSE_KEY` environment variable**
3. **Cached key** (lowest)

> **Note**: For Anonymous Trial, no license key is needed. Simply run `qbpp-license -a` without setting a key.

## Checking License Status

To display the current license status without making any changes:

```bash
qbpp-license
```

This shows the license type, expiry date, variable limits, and activation usage. The command contacts the license server to refresh the status.

## Deactivating a License

To move a license to another machine, first deactivate it on the current machine:

```bash
qbpp-license -d
```

- Each license key has a limited number of allowed activations.
- Deactivation frees up one activation slot.
- **Anonymous Trial** licenses cannot be deactivated.
- There is a **24-hour cooldown** between consecutive deactivations to prevent abuse.


## Command Reference

```
Usage: qbpp-license [options]

Options:
  -h, --help         Show help message and exit
  -k, --key KEY      Specify a license key
  -a, --activate     Activate the license on this machine
  -d, --deactivate   Deactivate the license on this machine
  -t, --time-out SEC Set the server communication timeout (default: 20 seconds)
```

### Examples

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `qbpp-license` | Display current license status |
| `qbpp-license -a` | Activate (Anonymous Trial if no key is set) |
| `qbpp-license -k KEY -a` | Activate with a specific key |
| `qbpp-license -d` | Deactivate the license on this machine |
| `qbpp-license -t 60` | Check status with a 60-second timeout |
| `qbpp-license -k KEY -t 60 -a` | Activate with a key and extended timeout |

## How License Verification Works

- **`qbpp-license` command**: Always contacts the license server to get the latest status. This may take a few seconds depending on network conditions.
- **QUBO++ programs**: Verify the license using the **local cache** and do not block on server communication. The server is contacted only when the cache needs to be refreshed (e.g., after a long period without synchronization).
- **License key storage**: When a license is activated, the key is encrypted and cached locally. This allows subsequent runs without setting the key again.


## Network and Timeout

If your network is slow or behind a firewall/proxy, the default 20-second timeout may not be enough.

To increase the timeout:

```bash
qbpp-license -t 60 -a
```

If the server is unreachable, QUBO++ falls back to the cached license status. If no cache exists, QUBO++ runs in **Fallback Mode** (100-variable limit).

### Programs work but with limited variables

- QUBO++ may be running in Fallback Mode. Check the license status:
  ```bash
  $ qbpp-license
  ```
- Ensure the license key is set correctly via `qbpp-license -k KEY -a` or `QBPP_LICENSE_KEY`.
- Re-activate if necessary: `qbpp-license -a`

### "Deactivation cooldown"

- There is a 24-hour waiting period between consecutive deactivations.
- Wait and try again after the cooldown period has elapsed.

## Floating Licenses

Floating licenses allow shared access across multiple machines within an organization. Instead of being permanently locked to a machine, a floating license uses a **lease-based** mechanism.

- When a QUBO++ program starts, it acquires a lease from the license server.
- The lease is automatically renewed while the program is running.
- When the program exits, the lease is released, making the slot available for other machines.
- If the program crashes or the network is lost, the lease expires automatically after a timeout period.

Usage is the same as node-locked licenses:

```bash
qbpp-license -k F-XXXXXX-XXXXXX-XXXXXX-XXXXXX -a
```

The floating license key is also cached locally, so subsequent runs do not require setting the key again.
