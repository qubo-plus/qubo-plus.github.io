# Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP)
The **Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP)** aims to find a set of routes for $V$ **vehicles** that start and end at a single **depot** and collectively serve all **customers**.
We index the **locations** by $i \in \lbrace 0,1,\ldots,N-1\rbrace$, where location 0 denotes the depot and locations $1,\ldots,N-1$ are customers.
Each customer $i\in \lbrace 1,\ldots,N-1\rbrace$ has a demand $d_i$ to be delivered (and we set $d_0=0$ for the depot).
Each vehicle $v \in \lbrace 0,\ldots,V-1\rbrace$ departs from the depot, visits a subset of customers, and returns to the depot, subject to the capacity constraint that the total delivered demand on its route does not exceed the vehicle capacity $q_v$.
The objective is to minimize the total travel cost over all vehicles.

We assume that locations are points in the two-dimensional plane and that the travel cost between two locations is the Euclidean distance.
Let $c_{i,j}$ denote the distance (cost) between locations $i$ and $j$.

## QUBO++ formulation: array of binary variables
We use a $V\times N\times N$ array $A=(a_{v,t,i})$ ($0\leq v\leq V, 0\leq t,i\leq N-1$) of binary variables to formulate the CVRP as a QUBO expression,
where $a_{v,t,i}$ is 1 if and only if the $t$-th visited location of vehicle $v$ is location $i$.

Below is an example assignment of $A=(a_{v,t,i})$ with $V=3$ and $N=10$ representing
a solution of the CVRP.
Each vehicle starts from the depot (location 0), visits some customers, and then returns to the depot.
After a vehicle returns to the depot, it stays at the depot for the remaining time steps.
Each customer $1, \ldots, 9$ is visited exactly once by exactly one vehicle, so this array represents a feasible CVRP solution.

## Constraints for QUB++ formulation

### Row constraint (one-hot at each time)
Each vehicle must be at exactly one location at each time $t$.
We impose the one-hot constraint:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\text{row}\_\text{constraint} & = \sum_{v=0}^{V-1}\sum_{t=0}^{N-1}\bigr(\sum_{i=0}^{N-1} a_{v,t,i} = 1\bigl)\\
 &= \sum_{v=0}^{V-1}\sum_{t=0}^{N-1}\bigr(1-\sum_{i=0}^{N-1} a_{v,t,i}\bigl)^2
\end{aligned}
$$

**row\_constraint** attains its minimum value $0$
if and only if every row is one-hot.

We also fix the first position to be the depot:

$$
\begin{aligned}
a_{v,0,0}& = 1 && (0\leq v\leq V-1) \\
a_{v,0,i}& = 0 && (0\leq v\leq V-1, 1\leq i\leq N-1)
\end{aligned}
$$

These can be enforced by fixing variables.

### Consecutive-depot constraint (no "leaving the depot again")
We disallow patterns where a vehicle returns to the depot and later visits customers again.
Using the depot-indicator variable $a_{v,t,0}$, we require that the sequence

$$
a_{v,1,0}, a_{v,2,0}, \ldots, a_{v,N-1,0}
$$

consists of consecutive 0's followed by consecutive 1's (i.e., once it becomes 1, it stays 1).
This is enforced by penalizing the forbidden transition $1\rightarrow 0$:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\text{consecutive}\_\text{constraint} &= \sum_{v=0}^{V-1}\sum_{t=1}^{N-2} (1-a_{v,t})a_{v,t+1}
\end{aligned}
$$

**consecutive\_constraint** attains 0 if and only if the depot indicators are monotone nondecreasing in
$t$ ($1\leq t\leq N-1$).

This constraint is redundant if the distance metric satisfies the triangle inequality (such "leave again" solutions cannot be optimal), but it often helps solvers avoid such non-optimal structures.

### Column constraint
Each customer must be visited exactly once by exactly one vehicle at exactly one time:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\text{column}\_\text{constraint}
& = \sum_{i=1}^{N-1}\bigr(\sum_{v=0}^{V-1}\sum_{t=0}^{N-1} a_{v,t,i} = 1\bigl)\\
 &= \sum_{i=1}^{N-1}\bigr(1-\sum_{v=0}^{V-1}\sum_{t=0}^{N-1} a_{v,t,i}\bigl)^2
\end{aligned}
$$

**column\_constraint** is 0 if and only if every customer $i = 1, \dots ,N−1$ is visited exactly once.

### Capacity constraint
For each vehicle $v$, the total delivered demand is

$$
\sum_{t=1}^{N-1}\sum_{i=1}^{N-1}d_ix_{t,i},
$$

which must be at most $q_v$.
Then the following constraint must be 0:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\text{capacity}\_\text{constraint} &= \sum_{v=0}^{V-1}\Bigr(0\leq \sum_{t=1}^{N-1}\sum_{i=1}^{N-1}d_ix_{t,i}\leq q_v\Bigl)
\end{aligned}
$$

**capacity\_constraint** is 0 if and only if all vehicles do not exceed their capacity.


## Objective for QUBO formulation

The total tour cost is computed from consecutive visited locations:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\text{objective} &= \sum_{v=0}^{V-1}\sum_{t=0}^{N-1}\sum_{i=0}^{N-1}\sum_{j=0}^{N-1}c_{i,j}x_{v,t,i}x_{v,(t+1)\bmod N, j}
\end{aligned}
$$

If vehicle $v$ visits location $i$ at time step $t$ and then moves to location $j$ at time step $(t+1)\bmod N$, we have $x_{v,t,i}=x_{v,(t+1)\bmod N, j}=1$.
In this case, the corresponding term contributes $c_{i,j}$ to the sum. Therefore, when all constraints are satisfied (so that each $(v,t)$ has exactly one active location),
$\text{objective}$ equals the total travel cost of all vehicles.

Under the Euclidean metric, we have $c_{i,i}=0$ for all $i$, so staying at the same location does not add extra cost.

## QUBO formulation for the CVRP

Combining the objective and constraints, we obtain the QUBO:

$$
\begin{aligned}
f &= \text{objective} + P\cdot (\text{row}\_\text{constraint}+\text{consecutive}\_\text{constraint}+\text{column}\_\text{constraint}+\text{capacity}\_\text{constraint}),
\end{aligned}
$$

where $P$ is a sufficiently large constant so that feasibility (constraints) is prioritized over cost minimization.

## QUBO++ program
The following QUBO++ program finds a solution to the CVRP instance with $N=10$ locations and $V=3$ vehicles.
The vector `locations` stores triples `(x,y,d)`, where  `(x,y)` is the 2D coordinate of the location and  `d` is the customer demand (with demand 0 for the depot).
The vector `vehicle_capacity` stores the capacities of the $V=3$ vehicles.
In this example, it is set to `{100, 200, 300}`, so vehicles 0, 1, and 2 have small, medium, and large capacities, respectively.

This program defines a $V\times N\times N$ array `a` of binary variables.
It then defines the objective term `objective` and the constraint terms
`row_constraint`, `column_constraint`. `consecutive_constraint` and `capacity_constraint`
according to the formulation described above, and combines them into the penalized objective
`f = objective + 10000 * ( row_constraint + column_constraint + consecutive_constraint + capacity_constraint )`.

To fix the first visited location ($t=0$)
of every vehicle to the depot (location 0), the program constructs a mapping `ml` and applies it to `f` using `qbpp::replace()`.
The resulting expression is stored in `g`.
The Easy Solver is then used to search for an assignment `sol` that minimizes `g`.

Since `g` does not contain the variables fixed by `ml`, the program merges `sol` and `ml` into `full_sol`, which assigns values to all variables in `a`.
Using `full_sol`, it prints the values of each `constraint` term and the `objective` value, and also prints the resulting tours of the $V=3$ vehicles.

For example, the program prints the following results:
```
row_constraint = 0
column_constraint = 0
consecutive_constraint = 0
vehicle_constraint = 0
objective = 2142
Vehicle 0 : load = 91 / 100 : 0 -> 4(91) -> 0
Vehicle 1 : load = 177 / 200 : 0 -> 6(59) -> 5(66) -> 8(52) -> 0
Vehicle 2 : load = 288 / 300 : 0 -> 7(10) -> 9(83) -> 1(44) -> 3(94) -> 2(57) -> 0
```
Finally, the program visualizes the obtained solution as a graph and writes it to `cvrp.svg`:
