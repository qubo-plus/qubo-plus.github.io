# Subgraph Isomorphism Problem
Given two undirected graphs $G_H=(V_H,E_H)$ (the host graph) and
$G_G=(V_G,E_G)$ (the guest graph), the **subgraph isomorphism problem** asks whether
$G_H$ contains a subgraph that is isomorphic to $G_G$.

More formally, the goal is to find an **injective mapping** $\sigma:V_G\rightarrow V_H$
such that, for every edge $(u,v)\in E_G$, the pair $(\sigma(u),\sigma(v))$ is also an edge of the host graph, i.e., $(\sigma(u),\sigma(v))\in E_H$.

For example, consider the following host and guest graphs:

One solution $\sigma$ is:

| node $i$ in $G_G$ | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| node $\sigma(i)$ in $G_H$ | 1 | 4 | 6 | 7 | 9 | 8 |


This solution is visualized as follows:

## QUBO formulation of the subgraph isomorphic problem
Assume that the g**uest graph** $G_G=(V_G,E_G)$ has $m$ nodes labeled $0, 1, \ldots m-1$, and
and the **host graph** $G_H=(V_H,E_H) $ has $n$ nodes labeled $0, 1, \ldots n-1$.
We introduce an $m\times n$ **binary matrix** $X=(x_{i,j})$ ($0\leq i\leq m-1, 0\leq j\leq n-1$) with $mn$ binary variables.
This matrix represents an injective mapping $\sigma:V_G\rightarrow V_H$
such that $x_{i,j}=1$ if and only if $\sigma(i)=j$.

For example, the solution of the subgraph isomorphism problem can be represented by the following  $6\times 10$ binary matrix:

| $i$ | $\sigma(i)$ | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| 0 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| 1 | 4 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| 2 | 6 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| 3 | 7 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 |
| 4 | 9 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 |
| 5 | 8 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 |

Because $X$ represents an injective mapping, it must satisfy the following constraints:
- **Row constraint**: Each guest node is mapped to exactly one host node, i.e., the sum of each row is 1.
- **Column constraint**: Each host node is used by at most one guest node, i.e., the sum of each column is 0 or 1.

These can be combined into the following **QUBO++-style constraint**, which attains its minimum value when all constraints are satisfied:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\text{constraint} &= \sum_{i=0}^{m-1}\Bigl(\sum_{j=0}^{n-1}x_{i,j} = 1\Bigr)+\sum_{j=0}^{m-1}\Bigl(0\leq \sum_{i=0}^{n-1}x_{i,j} \leq 1\Bigr)
\end{aligned}
$$

In QUBO form, we can express the same constraints as:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\text{constraint}
 &=  \sum_{i=0}^{m-1}\Bigl(\sum_{j=0}^{n-1}x_{i,j} - 1\Bigr)^2+\sum_{j=0}^{m-1}\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}x_{i,j}\Bigl(\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}x_{i,j}-1\Bigr)
\end{aligned}
$$

Next, we define the objective as the number of guest edges that are mapped to host edges:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\text{objective} &= \sum_{(u_G,v_G)\in E_G}\sum_{(u_H,v_H)\in E_H} (x_{u_G,u_H}x_{v_G,v_H}+x_{u_G,v_H}x_{v_G,u_H})
\end{aligned}
$$

Here, an undirected guest edge $(u_G,v_G)\in E_G$ can correspond to a host edge $(u_H,v_H)\in E_H$  in two symmetric ways:
- $(u_G, v_G)\mapsto (u_H,v_H)$
- $(u_G, v_G)\mapsto (v_H,u_H)$

Therefore, we include both quadratic terms $x_{u_G,u_H}x_{v_G,v_H}$ and $x_{u_G,v_H}x_{v_G,u_H}$.

Finally, we combine the objective and the constraint into a single QUBO expression:

$$
\begin{aligned}
f  &= -\text{objective} + mn\times \text{constraint}
\end{aligned}
$$

The penalty coefficient $mn$ is chosen so that satisfying the constraints is prioritized over improving the objective.
The best possible value of $f$ is attained when the constraint term is zero and the objective equals the number of guest edges.

## QUBO++ program of the subgraph isomorphic problem
Based on the QUBO formulation above, the following QUBO++ program solves the subgraph isomorphism problem for a guest graph with $M=6$ nodes and a host graph with $N=10$ nodes:
{% raw %}
```cpp
#include <qbpp/qbpp.hpp>
#include <qbpp/easy_solver.hpp>
#include <qbpp/graph.hpp>

int main() {
  const size_t N = 10;
  std::vector<std::pair<size_t, size_t>> host = {
      {0, 1}, {0, 2}, {1, 3}, {1, 4}, {1, 6}, {2, 5}, {3, 7}, {4, 6},
      {4, 7}, {5, 6}, {5, 8}, {6, 8}, {6, 7}, {7, 9}, {8, 9}};

  const size_t M = 6;
  std::vector<std::pair<size_t, size_t>> guest = {
      {0, 1}, {0, 2}, {1, 2}, {1, 3}, {2, 3}, {2, 5}, {3, 4}, {4, 5}};

  auto x = qbpp::var("x", M, N);

  auto host_assigned = qbpp::vector_sum(x, 0);

  auto constraint = qbpp::sum(qbpp::vector_sum(x, 1) == 1) +
                    qbpp::sum(0 <= host_assigned <= 1);

  auto objective = qbpp::toExpr(0);

  for (const auto& e_g : guest) {
    for (const auto& e_h : host) {
      objective += x[e_g.first][e_h.first] * x[e_g.second][e_h.second] +
                   x[e_g.first][e_h.second] * x[e_g.second][e_h.first];
    }
  }

  auto f = -objective + constraint * (M * N);

  f.simplify_as_binary();

  auto solver = qbpp::EasySolver(f);
  auto sol = solver.search({{"target_energy", std::to_string(-static_cast<int>(guest.size()))}});

  std::cout << "sol(x) = " << sol(x) << std::endl;

  std::cout << "sol(objective) = " << sol(objective) << std::endl;
  std::cout << "sol(constraint) = " << sol(constraint) << std::endl;

  auto guest_to_host = qbpp::onehot_to_int(sol(x), 1);
  std::cout << "guest_to_host = " << guest_to_host << std::endl;

  auto host_to_guest = qbpp::onehot_to_int(sol(x), 0);
  std::cout << "host_to_guest = " << host_to_guest << std::endl;

  qbpp::graph::GraphDrawer guest_graph;
  for (size_t i = 0; i < M; ++i) {
    guest_graph.add(qbpp::graph::Node(i));
  }
  for (const auto& e : guest) {
    guest_graph.add(qbpp::graph::Edge(e.first, e.second));
  }
  guest_graph.write("guest_graph.svg");

  qbpp::graph::GraphDrawer host_graph;
  for (size_t i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
    host_graph.add(qbpp::graph::Node(i));
  }
  for (const auto& e : host) {
    host_graph.add(qbpp::graph::Edge(e.first, e.second));
  }
  host_graph.write("host_graph.svg");

  qbpp::graph::GraphDrawer graph;
  for (size_t i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
    graph.add(qbpp::graph::Node(i).color(sol(host_assigned[i])));
  }

  std::vector<std::vector<bool>> guest_adj(N, std::vector<bool>(N, false));
  for (auto [u, v] : guest) {
    guest_adj[u][v] = guest_adj[v][u] = true;
  }
  for (const auto& e_h : host) {
    auto u = host_to_guest[e_h.first];
    auto v = host_to_guest[e_h.second];
    if (u != -1 && v != -1 &&
        guest_adj[static_cast<size_t>(u)][static_cast<size_t>(v)]) {
      graph.add(
          qbpp::graph::Edge(e_h.first, e_h.second).color(1).penwidth(2.0f));
    } else {
      graph.add(qbpp::graph::Edge(e_h.first, e_h.second));
    }
  }

  graph.write("subgraph_isomorphism.svg");
}
```
{% endraw %}

The guest and host graphs are given as the edge lists guest and host, respectively.
We define an $M\times N$ binary matrix `x`, and then construct the expressions `constraint`, `objective`, and `f` according to the formulation above.

An Easy Solver instance is created for `f`, and the target energy is set to
$−∣E_G|$ (the negative number of guest edges), which is the best possible value of `-objective` when all guest edges are mapped to host edges.
The obtained solution is stored in `sol`.
The values of `x`, `objective`, and `constraint` under `sol` are then printed.

Using the function **`qbpp::onehot_to_int()`**, the program also outputs the mappings from guest nodes to host nodes (`guest_to_host`, $\sigma$) and from host nodes to guest nodes (`host_to_guest`,$\sigma^{-1}$).

The guest and host graphs are saved as `guest_graph.svg` and `host_graph.svg`, respectively.
Finally, the solution is visualized in `subgraph_isomorphism.svg`, where the host nodes selected by the mapping and the host edges corresponding to guest edges are highlighted.

This program produces the following output:
{% raw %}
```cpp
sol(x) = {{0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0},{0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0},{0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0},{0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0},{0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1},{0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0}}
sol(objective) = 8
sol(constraint) = 0
guest_to_host = {1,4,6,7,9,8}
host_to_guest = {-1,0,-1,-1,1,-1,2,3,5,4}
```
{% endraw %}
The objective value equals the number of guest edges ($|E_G|=8$), and all constraints are satisfied (`constraint` = 0).
Therefore, the program finds an optimal solution that corresponds to a valid subgraph isomorphism.
Note that an entry of host_to_guest is `-1` if the corresponding host node is not mapped from any guest node.
